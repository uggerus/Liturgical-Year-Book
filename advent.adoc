== INTRODUCTION.

The name of Dom Gueranger, Abbot of Soles- mes, needs no recommendation. He has been long known,
both in his own country and in England, by his pious and edifying Works.

The Work which is now put within the reach of those, who use only our own language, is
truly Benedictine in its aim and spirit. The Sons of Saint Dominic have attached themselves
to the scientific Theology of the Church, and their mis- sion is to cry aloud in the streets
as Preachers, and to stand in the breach as defenders of the Faith. The Sons of Saint Benedict
have a more tranquil mission, within the walls of the Sanc- tuary, and on the steps of the Altar.
The Annee Liturgique is the fruit of this interior and peaceful spirit. It is a prolonged
meditation on the wonderful order of Divine Worship, which has formed itself around the
Presence of the Incarnate Word. It is the adoration of the Father in Spirit and in Truth in the
circle of His Divine acts for the redemption of the world. The Calendar of the Church renews
before our spiritual and intellectual vision, — it may almost be said, before our eyes of
Sense, — the Suprem e Worship of the Ever Blessed Trinity, in the Communion of the Saints.
Into this in- terior world of heavenly beauty, splendour, and peace, the Liturgy of the Church
admits us day by day. And the Abbot of Solesmes has ren- dered a signal help to all who love
this prelude of a better world, and this avenue to the Vision of peace, by his beautiful and
spiritual com- mentary on our Seasons and Solemnities. Our thanks are also due to the Eev.
Father Shep- herd, O.S.B., for the patience and care with which he has undertaken this

== GENERAL PREFACE.

PRAYER is man's richest boon. It is his light, his nourishment, and his very life, for it brings
him into communication with God, who is light? nourishment? and life? But, of ourselves, we know
not what we should pray for as we ought ;4 we must needs, there- fore, address ourselves to Jesus Christ, and say to him as the Apostles did : Lord, teach us how to pray.5 He alone can make the dumb speak, and give elo- quence to the mouths of children ; and this prodigy he effects by sending his Spirit of grace, and of prayers,6 who delights in helping our infirmity, ashing for us with unspeakable groanings.7

Now, it is in the holy Church that this divine Spirit dwells. He came down to her as an impetuous wind, and manifested himself to her under the ex- pressive symbol of tongues of fire. Ever since that day of Pentecost, he has dwelt in this his favoured Spouse. He is the principle of everything that is in her. He it is that prompts her prayers, her desires,

her canticles of praise, her enthusiasm, and even her mourning. Hence, her Prayer is as uninterrupted as her existence. Day and night is her voice sound- ing sweetly on the ear of her divine Spouse, and her words are ever finding a welcome in his heart.

At one time, under the impulse of that Spirit, which animated the admirable Psalmist and the Pro- phets, she takes the subject of her canticles from the Books of the Old Testament ; at another, showing herself to be the daughter and sister of the holy Apostles, she intones the canticles written in the Books of the New Covenant; and finally, remember- ing that she, too, has had given to her the trumpet and harp, she at times gives way to the Spirit which animates her, and sings her own new canticle} From these three sources comes the divine element which we call the Liturgy,

The Prayer of the Church is, therefore, the most pleasing to the ear and heart of God, and therefore the most efficacious of all prayers. Happy, then, is he who prays with the Church, and unites his own petitions with those of this Spouse, who is so dear to her Lord, that he gives her all she asks. It was for this reason that our Blessed Saviour taught us to say our Father, and not my Father ; give us, forgive us, deliver us, and not give me, forgive me, deliver me. Hence, we find that, for upwards of a thousand years, the Church, who prays in her temples seven times in the day, and once again during the night, did not pray alone. The people kept her company, and fed

themselves with delight on the manna which is hidden under the words and mysteries of the divine Liturgy. Thus initiated into the sacred Cycle of the mysteries of the Christian year, the faithful, atten- tive to the teachings of the Spirit, came to know the secrets of eternal life ; and, without any farther pre- paration, a Christian was not unfrequently chosen by the Bishops to be a Priest, or even a Bishop, that he might go and pour out on the people the treasures of wisdom and love, which he had drunk in at the very fountain-head.

For whilst Prayer said in union with the Church is the light of the understanding, it is the fire of divine love for the heart. The Christian soul neither needs nor wishes to avoid the company of the Church, when she would converse with God, and praise his greatness and his mercy. She knows that the com- pany of the Spouse of Christ could not be a distrac- tion to her. Is not the soul herself a part of this Church, which is the Spouse ? Has not Jesus Christ said : Father, may they be one, as we also are one ?l and, when many are gathered in his name, does not this same Saviour assure us that he is in the midst of them ? 2 The soul, therefore, may converse freely with her God, who tells her that he is so near her ; she may sing praise, as David did, in the sight of the Angels,3 whose eternal prayer blends with the prayer which the Church utters in time.

But for now many past ages, Christians have grown too solicitous about earthly things to frequent the

holy Vigils, and the mystical Hours of the day. Long before the Rationalism of the sixteenth century became the auxiliary of the heresies of that period by curtailing the solemnity of the Divine Service, the days for the people's uniting exteriorly with the Prayer of the Church had been reduced to Sundays and Festivals. During the rest of the year, the solemn and imposing grandeur of the Liturgy was gone through, and the people took no share in it. Each new generation increased in indifference for that which their forefathers in the faith had loved as their best and strongest food. Social prayer was made to give way to individual devotion. Chanting, which is the natural expression of the prayers and even of the sorrows of the Church, became limited to the solemn feasts. That was the first sad revolu- tion in the Christian world.

But, even then, Christendom was still rich in churches and monasteries, and there, day and night, was still heard the sound of the same venerable prayers which the Church had used through all the past ages. So many hands lifted up to God drew down upon the earth the dew of heaven, averted storms, and won victory for those who were in battle. These servants of God, who thus kept up an untiring choir that sang the divine praises, were considered as solemnly deputed by the people, which was still Catholic, to pay the full tribute of homage and thanksgiving due to God, his Blessed Mother and the Saints. These prayers formed a treasury which be- longed to all. The faithful gladly united themselves in spirit to what was done. When any affliction, or

the desire to obtain a special favour, led them to the house of God, they were sure to hear, no matter at what hour they went, that untiring voice of prayer which was for ever ascending to heaven for the salva- tion of mankind. At times they would give up their worldly business and cares, and take part in the Office of the Church, and all still understood, at least in a general way, the mysteries of the Liturgy.

Then came the Reformation, and, at the onset, it attacked the very life of Christianity; — it would put an end to the sacrifice of man's praise of his God. It strewed many countries with the ruins of churches ; the Clergy, the Monks, and Virgins consecrated to God, were banished or put to death ; and in the churcheswhich were spared, the divine Offices were not permitted. In other countries, where the persecution was not so violent, many sanctuaries were devastated and irremediably ruined, so that the life and voice of Prayer grew faint. Faith, too, was weakened ; na- tionalism became fearfully developed ; and now, our own age seems threatened with what is the result of these evils, — the subversion of all social order.

For, when the Reformation had abated the violence of its persecution, it had other weapons wherewith to attack the Church. By these, several countries, which continued to be Catholic, were infected with that spirit of pride, which is the enemy of Prayer. The modern spirit would have it, that Prayer is not Action: — as though every good action, done by man, were not a gift of God ; a gift which implies two prayers : one of petition, that it may be granted ; and another of thanksgiving, because it is granted ! There

were found men who said, Let us abolish all the fes- tival days of God from the earth ;a and then came upon ns that calamity which brings all others with it, and which the good Mardochai besought God to avert from his nation, when he said, Shut not, 0 Lord, the mouths of them that sing to thee !2

But, by the mercy of God, we have not been con- sumed ; 3 there have been left remnants of Israel f and the number of believers in the Lord has increased.5 What is it that has moved the heart of our God to bring about this merciful conversion ? Prayer, which had been interrupted, has been resumed. Numerous choirs of Virgins consecrated to God, and, though far less in number, of men who have left the world to spend themselves in the divine praises, make the voice of the turtle-dove heard in our land.6 This voice is every day gaining more power: may it find acceptance from our Lord, and move him to show the sign of his covenant with us, the rainbow of reconciliation ! May our venerable Cathedrals again re-echo those solemn formulas of Prayer, which heresy has so long suppressed ! May the faith and munificence of the faithful reproduce the prodigies of those past ages, which owed their greatness to the acknowledgment, which all, even the very civic authorities, paid to the all-powerfulness of Prayer !

But this Liturgical Prayer would soon become powerless, were the faithful not to take a real share in it, or, at least, not to associate themselves to it in

heart. It can heal and save the world, but only on the condition that it be understood. Be wise, then, ye children of the Catholic Church, and get that largeness of heart which will make you pray the Prayer of your Mother. Come, and by your share in it, fill up that harmony which is so sweet to the ear of God. Where would you obtain the spirit of Prayer if not at its natural source ? Let us remind you of the exhortation of the Apostle to the first Christians : Let the peace of Christ rejoice in your hearts, — let the Word of Christ divell in you abun- dantly, in all wisdom ; teaching and admonishing one another, in Psalms, Hymns, and spiritual Canticles, singing in grace in your hearts to God} For a long time, a remedy has been devised for an evil which was only vaguely felt. The spirit of Prayer, and even Prayer itself, has been sought for in methods, and Prayer Books, which contain, it is true, laudable, yea, pious thoughts, but, after all, only human thoughts. Such nourishment cannot satisfy the soul, for it does not initiate her into the Prayer of the Church. In- stead of uniting her with the Prayer of the Church, it isolates her. Of this kind are so many of those collections of prayers and reflections, which have been published, under different titles, during the last two hundred years, and by which it was intended to edify the faithful, and suggest to them, either for hearing Mass, or going to the Sacraments, or keeping the Feasts of the Church, certain more or less com- monplace considerations and acts, always drawn up

according to the manner of thought and sentiment peculiar to the author of each book. Each Manual had consequently its own way of treating these im- portant subjects. To Christians already formed to piety, such books as these, would, indeed, serve a pur- pose, especially as nothing better was offered to them : but they had not influence sufficient to inspire with a relish and spirit of Prayer such as had not other- wise received them.

It may perhaps be objected, that were all practical books of Christian piety to be reduced to mere expla- nations of the Liturgy, we should run the risk of impoverishing, and even destroying, by excessive for- malities, the spirit of Prayer and Contemplation, which is such a precious gift of the Holy Ghost to the Church of God. To this we answer firstly, that by asserting the immense superiority of Liturgical over individual Prayer, we do not say that indivi- dual methods should be suppressed; we would only wish them to be kept in their proper place. Then secondly, we answer that in the divine Psalmody there are several degrees : the lowest are near enough to the earth to be reached by souls that are still plod- ding in the fatigues of the purgative way ; but in proportion as a soul ascends this mystic ladder, she feels herself illuminated by a heavenly ray ; and still higher, she finds union and rest in the Sovereign Good. Whence, for instance, did the holy Doctors of the early ages, and the venerable Patriarchs of the desert, acquire their spiritual knowledge and tender devotion, of which they have left us such treasures in their writings and their works ? It was from those

long hours of Psalmody, during which Truth, simple yet manifold, unceasingly passed before the eyes of their soul, rilling it with streams of light and love. What was it that gave to the seraphic Bernard that wonderful unction, which runs in streams of honey through all his writings ? To the author of the Imi- tation of Christ that sweetness, that hidden manna, which seems ever fresh ? To Louis Blosius, that inex- pressible charm and tenderness which move the heart of every reader ? It was the daily use of the Liturgy, in the midst of which they spent their days, inter- mingling their songs of joy with those of their sorrow.

Let not then the soul, the spouse of Christ, that is possessed with a love of Prayer, be afraid that her thirst cannot be quenched by these rich streams of the Liturgy, which now flow calmly as a streamlet, now roll with the loud impetuosity of a torrent, and now swell with the mighty heavings of the sea. Let her come and drink this clear water which springeth up unto life everlasting ;* for this water flows from the very fountains of her Saviour f and the Spirit of God animates it by his virtue, rendering it sweet and refreshing to the panting stag.3 Neither let a soul, that is in love with the charms of Contemplation, be afraid of the pomp and harmony of the chants of Li- turgical Prayer, as though they could distract her; for what is this soul herself but an instrument of harmony responding to the touch of that divine Spirit which possesses her ? Would she, when she wishes to enjoy

the heavenly interview, comport herself differently from the Royal Psalmist himself, that model of all true Prayer, recognised as such by God and the Church ? Yet he, when he would enkindle the sacred flame within his breast, has recourse to his harp : My heart is ready, he says ; 0 God, my heart is ready ; I will sing, I will give forth a Psalm. A rise, my glory ! arise, psaltery and harp ! I will arise in the morning early. I will praise thee, 0 Lord, among the people ; and I will sing unto thee among the nations. For thy mercy is great above the heavens, and thy truth even unto the clouds.1 At other times, if, in the interior recollection of the senses, he have entered into the powers of the Lord,,2 then, in his meditation, afireflameth out,z a fire of holy excitement; and to assuage the heat which is burning within him, he bursts out into another canticle, saying : My heart hath uttered a good word; I speak my works to the King ; and publishes again and again the beauty and victories of the Bridegroom, and the graces of the Bride.4 So true is it, that for Contemplative souls, Liturgical Prayer is both the principle and the consequence of the visits they re- ceive from God.

But in nothing is the excellency of the Liturgy so apparent, as in its being milk for children, and solid food for the strong ; thus resembling the miraculous bread of the desert, and taking every kind of taste according to the different dispositions of those who

eat. It is, indeed* a divine property, which has not unfrequently been noticed even by those who are not of the number of God's children, and has forced them to acknowledge that the Catholic Church alone knows the secret of Prayer. Nay, might it not be said that the reason of the Protestants having no Ascetic writers, is that they have no real Liturgical Grayer ? It is true, that a sufficient explanation of the abso- lute want of unction, which characterises all that the Reformation has produced, is to be found in its deny- ing the Holy Sacrament of the Eucharist, which is the centre of all Religion : but this is virtually the same as saying that Protestants have no Liturgical Prayer, inasmuch as the Liturgy is so essentially and inti- mately connected with the Eucharist. So true is this, that wheresoever the dogma of the Real Presence has ceased to be believed, there also have the Canonical Hours ceased, and could not but cease.

It is therefore Jesus Christ himself who is the source as well as the object of the Liturgy; and hence the Ecclesiastical Year which we have undertaken to explain in this work, is neither more nor less than the manifestation of Jesus Christ, and his Mysteries, in the Church and the faithful soul. It is the divine Cycle, in which appear all the works of God, each in its turn ; the Seven Days of the Creation ; the Pasch and Pentecost of the Jewish people ; the ineffable Visit of the Incarnate Word ; His Sacrifice and His Victory; the Descent of the Holy Ghost; the Holy Eucharist ; the surpassing glories of the Mother of God, ever a Virgin ; the magnificence of the Angels ; the merits and triumphs of the Saints. Thus, the

12 GENERAL PREFACE.

Cycle of the Church may be said to have its beginning under the Patriarchal Law, its progress under the Written Law, and its completion under the Law of Love, in which, at length, having attained its last per- fection, it will disappear in eternity, as the Written Law gave way the day on which the invincible power of the Blood of the Lamb rent asunder the veil of the Temple.

Would that we might worthily describe the sacred wonders of this mystical Calendar, of which all others are bat images and humble auxiliaries ! Happy in- deed should we deem ourselves, if we could make the faithful understand the grand glory which is given to the Blessed Trinity, to our Saviour, to Mary, to the Angels, and to the Saints, by this annual commemo- ration of the wondrous works of our God ! If, every year, the Church renews her youth as that of the eagle,1 she does so because, by means of the Cycle of the Liturgy, she is visited by her divine Spouse, who supplies all her wants. Each year she again sees him an Infant in the manger, fasting in the desert, offer- ing himself on the Cross, rising from the grave, founding his Church, instituting the Sacraments, as- cending to the right hand of his Father, and sending the Holy Ghost upon men. The graces of all these divine mysteries are renewed in her ; so that, being made fruitful in every good thing, the mystic Garden yields to the Spouse, in every season, under the influence of the spirit he breathes into her, the sweet perfume of aromatic sfAces? Each year, the

Spirit of God retakes possession of his well Beloved, and gives her light and love ; each year she derives an increase of life from the maternal influence which the Blessed Virgin exercises over her, on the feasts of her joys, her dolours, and her glories-, and lastly, the brilliant constellations formed by the successive ap- pearance of the nine choirs of the Angels, and the Saints in their varied orders of Apostles, Martyrs, Confessors, and Virgins, shed on her, each year, power- ful help and abundant consolation.

Now, what the Liturgical Year does for the Church at large, it does also for the soul of each one of the faithful th?4 is careful to receive the gift of God. This succession of mystic seasons imparts to the Christian the elements of that supernatural life, with- out which every other life is but a sort of death, more or less disguised. Nay, there are some souls, so far acted upon by the divine succession of the Catholic Cycle, that they experience even a physical effect from each evolution: the supernatural life has gained ascendency over the natural, and the Ca- lendar of the Church makes them forget that of Astronomers.

Let the Catholic who reads this work be on his guard against that coldness of faith, and that want of love, which have well-nigh turned into an object of indifference that admirable Cycle of the Church, which heretofore was, and always ought to be, the joy of the people, the source of light to the learned, and the book]of the humblest of the faithful.

The reader will rightly infer from what we have said, that the object we have in view is not, in any

14 GENEEAL PREFACE.

way, to publish some favourite or clever method of our own with regard to the Mysteries of the Ecclesi- astical Year, nor to make them subjects for eloquence, philosophy, or intellectual fancy. We have bat one aim, and we humbly ask of God that we may attain it ; it is to serve as interpreter to the Church, in order thus to enable the faithful to follow her in her Prayer of each mystic season, nay, of each day and hour. God forbid, that we should ever presume to put our human thoughts side by side with those which our Lord Jesus Christ, who is the Wisdom of God, inspires by the Holy Ghost to his well-beloved Spouse the Church ! All that we would do is to show what is the spirit which the Holy Ghost has put into each of the several periods of the Liturgical Year ; and for this purpose, to study attentively the most ancient and venerable Liturgies, and embody in our explana- tion the sentiments of the Holy Fathers and the old- est and most approved Liturgists. With these helps we hope to give to the faithful the flowers of Eccle- siastical Prayer, and thus unite, as far as possible, practical usefulness with the charm of variety.

In this work we shall lay great stress on the cultus of the Saints, inasmuch as it is always needed, but now more than ever. Devotion to the adorable Per- son of our Saviour has revived among us with a vigorous development; devotion to our Blessed Lady has wonderfully spread and increased ; let the Saints also receive our honour and our confidence, and then the last traces of the unhappy spirit introduced by Jansenism will disappear. But, since we cannot in- troduce all the Saints into our Calendar, we shall

GENERAL PREFACE. 15

limit ourselves, almost exclusively, to those inserted in that of Rome.

Nevertheless, the Roman Liturgy is not the only one we intend to give, though of course it will be the most prominent, as being the very basis of our Litur- gical Year. The Ambrosian, the Gallican, the Gothic or Mozarabic, the Greek, the Armenian, the Syriac Liturgies will, each in its turn, give us of their riches and form our treasury of Prayers ; and thus, never will the voice of the Church have been fuller and more impressive. The Western Churches, during the Middle Ages, have inserted, into the Liturgy oi some of the Feasts, Sequences so admirable for their unction and doctrine, that we shall consider it a duty to give them to the faithful as often as occasion serves.

The plan we shall follow in each volume of this Liturgical Year, will depend upon the subjects which must be treated of in each respectively. Everything that relates to the merely scientific bearing of the Liturgy, will be reserved for our " Liturgical Insti- tutions" The present work will be limited to those details, which are necessary to be understood by the faithful in order to their entering into the Spirit of the Church, during the several mystic seasons of the year. The sacred formulae will be explained and adapted to the use of the laity by means of a com- mentary, in which we shall endeavour to avoid both the imprudence of a literal translation, and the dul- ness of a tedious and insipid paraphrase.

Since, as we have already said, our aim is to pre- sent to the faithful the most solid and useful portions of the Liturgies, we have excluded from our selection

16 GENERAL PREFACE-

all such as seemed to us not to answer our purpose. This observation refers mainly to the portions selected from the Offices of the Greek Church. Nothing is finer and more impressive than this Liturgy, when read in chosen extracts; but nothing is so disap- pointing when taken as a whole. The monotony of phrases is insupportable, and the endless repetitions of the same idea spoil the real unction contained in it. We have therefore selected only the richest flowers of this over-stocked garden : more than these would have been a burden. These remarks apply especially to the Mencea and Anthologia of the Greek Church. The Liturgical books of the other Eastern Churches are generally drawn up with better taste and more discretion.

In order to conform with the wishes of the Holy See, we do not give, in any of the volumes of our Liturgical Year, the literal translation of the Ordi- nary and Canon of the Mass ; and have, in its place, endeavoured to give, to such of the laity as do not understand Latin, the means of uniting, in the closest possible manner, with everything that the Priest says and does at the altar.

The first part of the Liturgical Year is devoted to Advent. The second contains the explanation of the divine service from Christmas to the Purifica- tion. The third takes us from the Purification as far as Lent, and is called Septuagesima. The fourth comprises the four first weeks of Lent The fifth consists of Passion Week and Holy Week. The sixth includes the time of Easter. The seventh will ex- plain the Office of the Church from Trinity to the

GENEKAL PEEFACE. 17

end of July. The eighth will give the two months, August and September. The ninth will finish the year, and contain the Liturgy of October and No- vember.

The year thus planned for us by the Church her- self, produces a drama, the sublimest that has ever been offered to the admiration of man. God inter- vening for the salvation and sanctification of men, — the reconciliation of justice with mercy, — the humilia- tions, the sufferings, and the glories of the God-Man, — the coming of the Holy Ghost, and his workings in humanity and in the faithful soul, — the mission and the action of the Church, — all are there portrayed in the most telling and impressive way. Each mystery has its time and place by means of the sublime suc- cession of the respective anniversaries. A divine fact happened eighteen hundred years ago ; its anni- versary is kept in the Liturgy, and its impression thus reiterated every year in the minds of the faith- ful, with a freshness as though God were then doing for the first time, what he did so many ages past. Human ingenuity could never have devised a system of such power as this. And those writers who are bold and frivolous enough to assert, that Christianity has no longer an influence in the world, and is now but the ruin of an ancient thing, — what should they not say at seeing these undying realities, this vigour, this endlessness of the Liturgical Year ? For what is the Liturgy but an untiring affirmation of the works of God % — a solemn acknowledgment of those divine facts, which, though done but once, are imperishable in man's remembrance, and are every year renewed

by the commemoration he makes of them ? Have we not our Writings of the Apostolic Age, our Acts of the Martyrs, our Decrees of ancient Councils, our Writings of the Fathers, our Monuments, — taking us to the very origin of Christianity, and testifying to the most explicit tradition regarding our Feasts ? It is true that the Liturgical Cycle has its integrity and its development nowhere but in the Catholic Church ; but the sects which are separated from her, whether by schism or by heresy, all pay the homage of their testimony to the divine origin of the Liturgy, by the pertinacity with which they cling to the rem- nants they have preserved, — remnants, by the way, to which they owe whatever vitality they still retain. But, though the Liturgy so deeply impresses us by its annually bringing before us the dramatic solemnisation of those mysteries, which have been accomplished for the salvation of man and for his union with his God ; it is nevertheless wonderful how the succession of year after year diminishes not one atom of the freshness and vehemence of those im- pressions, and each new beginning of the Cycle of mystic seasons seems to be our first year. Advent is ever impregnated with the spirit of a sweet and mysterious expectation. Christmas ever charms us with the incomparable joy of the birth of the divine Child. We enter, with the well-known feeling, into the gloom of Septuagesima. Lent comes, and we prostrate ourselves before God's justice, and our heart is filled with a salutary fear and compunction, which seem so much keener than they were the year before. The Passion of our Redeemer, followed in every

GENERAL PREFACE. 19

minutest detail, does it not seem as though we never knew it till that year ? The pageant of Easter makes us so glad, that our former Easters appear to have been only half- kept. The triumphant Ascension discloses to us, upon the whole economy of the In- carnation, secrets which we never knew before this year. When the Holy Ghost comes down at Pente- cost, is it not the case, that we so thrill with the renewal of the great Presence, that our emotions of last Whit Sunday seem too" tame for this ? However habituated we get to the ineffable gift which Jesus made us on the eve of his Passion, the bright dear feast of Corpus Christi brings strange increase of love to our heart; and the Blessed Sacrament seems more our own than ever. The feasts of our Blessed Lady come round, each time revealing something more of her greatness ; and the Saints, — with whom we fancied we had become so thoroughly acquainted, — each year as they visit us, seem so much grander, we understand them better, we feel more sensibly the link there is between them and ourselves.

This renovative power of the Liturgical Year, to which we wish to draw the attention of our readers, is a mystery of the Holy Ghost, who unceasingly animates the work which he has inspired the Church to establish among men ; that thus they might sanctify that time which has been given to them for the worship of their Creator. The renovation works also a twofold growth in the mind of man, — the in- crease of knowledge of the truths of faith, and the development of the supernatural life. There is not a single point of Christian doctrine which, in the course

20 GENERAL PREFACE.

of the Liturgical Year, is not brought forward, nay, which is not inculcated, with that authority and unction, wherewith our Holy Mother the Church has so deeply impregnated her words and her elegant rites. The faith of the believer is thus enlightened more and more each year; the theological sensus is formed in him ; Prayer leads him to science. Mysteries con- tinue to be mysteries ; but their brightness becomes so vivid, that the mind and heart are enchanted, and we begin to imagine what a joy the eternal sight of these divine beauties will produce in us, when the glimpse of them through the clouds is such a charm to us.

Yes, there must needs be great progress in a Chris- tian soul, when the object of her faith is ever gaining greater light; when the hope of her salvation is almost forced upon her by the sight of all those wonders which God's goodness has wrought for his creatures ; and when charity is enkindled within her under the breath of the Holy Ghost, who has made the Liturgy to be the centre of his working in men's souls. Is not the formation of Christ within us1 the result of our uniting in his various nrysteries, the joyful, the sorroicful, and the glorious ? These mysteries of Jesus come into us, are incorporated into 11s, each year, by the powei of the special grace which the Liturgy produces by communicating them to us: the new man gradually grows up, even on the ruins of the old. Then again, in order that the divine type may the more easily be stamped upon us, wTe need examples ; we want to see how our fellow-men have

1 Gal. iv. 19.

GENERAL PREFACE. 21

realised that type in themselves ; and the Liturgy- does this for us, by offering us the practical teaching and the encouragement of our dear Saints, who shine like stars in the firmament of the ecclesiastical year. By dint of looking upon them we come to learn the way which leads to Jesus, just as Jesus is our Way which leads to the Father. But above all the Saints, and brighter than them all, we have Mary, showing us, in her single self, the Mirror of Justice, in which is reflected all the sanctity possible in a pure creature. Finally, the Liturgical Year, the plan of which we have been explaining, will bring continually before us the sublimest poetry that the human mind has conceived. Not only will it enable us to understand the divine songs of David and the Prophets, on which mainly the Liturgy has formed her own; but the Cycle will elicit from the Church, according as the different seasons and feasts come on, canticles and hymns the finest, the sublimest, and the worthiest of the subject. We shall hear the several countries, united as they are in one common faith, pouring forth their admiration and love in accents, wherein are blended the most perfect harmony of thought and sentiment, with the most marked diversity of genius and expression. We exclude from our collection, as duty requires we should, certain modern compositions, which had too close a resemblance to pagan literature, and which, as they had not received the sanction of the Church's acceptance, were likely to be short-lived : but the productions of liturgical genius, no matter of what age in the Church, are profusely admitted ; from Sedulius and Prudentius, down to Adam of Saint

Victor and his cotemporaries, for the Latin Church ; and from St. Ephrem, down to the latest Catholic Byzantine Hymnologists, for the Greek Church. A rich vein of poetry will be found as well in the prayers which have been composed in simple prose, as in those which are presented to us in the garb of measure and rhythm. Poetry, being the only lan- guage adequate to the sublime thought which is to be expressed, is to be found everywhere in the Liturgy, as it is in the inspired Writings ; and a complete col- lection of the formulas of public prayer, would be, at the same time, the richest selection of Christian Poetry : — of that Poetry, which sings on earth the mysteries of heaven, and prepares us for the canticles of eternity.

In concluding this General Preface, we beg to re- mind our readers, that in a work like the present, the success of the writer is absolutely dependent upon the Holy Spirit, who breatheth where he willeth,1 and that the most which man can do is to "plant and water.2 We venture therefore to ask the children of the Church, who desire to see her Prayer loved and used above all others, to aid us by recommending our work to God, that so our unworthiness may not be an obstacle to what we have undertaken, and which we feel to be so much above our strength.

We have only to add, that we submit our work, both in its substance and its form, to the sovereign and infallible judgment of the Holy Roman Church, which alone is the guardian both of the Words of eternal life, and of the secret of Prayer.

CHAPTER THE FIRST.

THE HISTORY OF ADVENT.

The name Advent1 is applied, in the Latin Church, to that period of the year, during which the Church requires the faithful to prepare for the celebration of the Feast of Christmas, the anniversary of the Birth of Jesus Christ. The mystery of that great day had every right to the honour of being prepared for by prayer and works of penance ; and, in fact, it is im- possible to state, with any certainty, when this season of preparation (which had long been observed before receiving its present name of Advent) was first instituted. It would seem, however, that its observance first began in the West, since it is evident that Advent could not have been looked on as a pre- paration for the Feast of Christmas, until that Feast was definitively fixed to the twenty-fifth of December : which was only done in the East, towards the close of the fourth century ; whereas, it is certain, that the Church of Rome kept the feast on that day at a much earlier period.

We must look upon Advent in two different lights : first, as a time of preparation, properly so called, for the Birth of our Saviour, by works of penance ; and

1 From the Latin word Adventus, which signifies a Coming.

24 ADVENT.

secondly, as a series of Ecclesiastical Offices drawn up for the same purpose. We find, as far back as the fifth century, the custom of giving exhortations to the people in order to prepare them for the Feast of Christmas. We have two Sermons of Saint Maximus of Turin on this subject, not to speak of several others, which were formerly attributed to St. Ambrose and St. Augustine, but which were proba- bly written by St. Cesarius of Aries. If these docu- ments do not tell us what was the duration and the exercises of this holy season, they at least show us how ancient was the practice of distinguishing the time of Advent by special sermons. St. Ivo of Chartres, St. Bernard, and several other Doctors of the eleventh and twelfth centuries, have left us set sermons de Adventu Domini, quite distinct from their Sunday Homilies on the Gospels of that season. In the Capitularia of Charles the Bald, in 846, the Bishops admonish that Prince not to call them away from their churches during Lent or Advent, under pretext of affairs of the State or the necessities of war, seeing that they have special duties to fulfil, and particularly that of preaching during those sacred times.

The oldest document, in which we find the length and exercises of Advent mentioned with anything like clearness, is a passage in the second book of the History of the Franks by St. Gregory of Tours, where he says that St. Perpetuus, one of his predecessors, who held that See about the year 480, had decreed a fast three times a week, from the feast of St. Martin until Christmas. It would be impossible to decide whether St. Perpetuus, by this regulation, established a new custom, or merely enforced an already existing law. Let us, however, note this interval of forty, or rather of forty-three days, so expressly mentioned, and consecrated to penance, as though it were a second

HISTOEY OF ADVENT. 25

Lent, though less strict and severe than that which precedes Easter.

Later on, we find the ninth canon of the first Council of Macon, he]d in 582, ordaining that during the same interval, between St. Martin's Day and Christmas, the Mondays, Wednesdays, and Fridays, should be fasting days, and that the Sacrifice should be celebrated according to'^ihe Lenten Rite. Not many years before that, namely in 567, the second Council of Tours had enjoined the monks to fast from the beginning of December till Christmas. This practice of penance soon extended to the whole forty days, even for the laity ; and it was commonly called St. Martin's Lent. The Capitularia of Charlemagne, in the sixth book, leave us no doubt on the matter; and Rabanus Maurus, in the second book of his Institution of Clerics, bears tes- timony to this observance. There were even special rejoicings made on St. Martin's Feast, just as we see them practised now at the approach of Lent and Easter.

The obligation of observing this Lent, which, though introduced so imperceptibly, had by degrees acquired the force of a sacred law, began to be relaxed, and the forty days from St. Martin's Day to Christmas were reduced to four weeks. We have seen that this fast began to be observed first in France ; but thence it spread into England, as we find from Venerable Bede's History ; into Italy, as appears from a diploma of Astolphus, King of the Lombards, dated 758 ; into Germany, Spain, &c, of which the proofs may be seen in the learned work of Dorn Martene, On the Ancient Rites of the Church. The first allusion to Advent's being reduced to four weeks, is to be found in the ninth century, in a letter of Pope St. Nicholas the First to the Bulgarians. The testimony of Ratherius of Verona, and of Abbo of Fleurjr, both writers of the tenth century, goes also to prove that, even then, the ques-

26 ADVENT.

tion of reducing the duration of trie Advent fast by one-third was seriously entertained. It is true, that St. Peter Damian, in the eleventh century, speaks of the Advent fast as still being for forty days ; and that St. Louis, two centuries later, kept it for that length of time ; but as far as this holy King is concerned, it is probable that it was only his own devotion which prompted him to this prac- tice.

The discipline of the Churches of the West, after having reduced the time of the Advent fast, so far relented, in a few years, as to change the fast into a simple abstinence ; and we even find Councils of the twelfth century, for instance, Selingstadt in 1122, and Avranches in 1172, which seem to require only the clergy to observe this abstinence. The Council of Salisbury, held in 1281, would seem to expect none but monks to keep it. On the other hand, (for the whole subject is very confused, owing, no doubt, to there never having been any uniformity of discipline regarding it in the Western Church,) we find Pope Innocent III, in his letter to the Bishop of Braga, mentioning the custom of fasting during the whole of Advent, as being at that time observed in Rome ; and Durandus, in the same thirteenth century, in his Rational on the Divine Offices, tells us that, in France, fasting was uninterruptedly observed during the whole of that holy time.

This much is certain, that, by degrees, the custom of fasting so far fell into disuse, that when, in 1362, Pope Urban the Fifth endeavoured to prevent the total decay of the Advent penance, all he insisted upon was that all the clerics of his court should keep abstinence during Advent, without in any way including others, either clergy or laity, in this law. St. Charles Borromeo also strove to bring back his people of Milan, to the spirit, if not to the letter, of ancient times. In his fourth Council, he enjoins the parish

HISTORY OF ADVENT. 27

priests to exhort the faithful to go to communion on the Sundays, at least, of Lent and Advent; and after- wards addressed to the faithful themselves a Pastoral Letter, in which, after having reminded them of the dispositions wherewith they ought to spend this holy time, he strongly urges them to fast on the Mondays, Wednesdays, and Fridays, at least, of each week in Advent. Finally, Pope Benedict the Fourteenth, when Archbishop of Bologna, following these illus- trious examples, wrote his eleventh Ecclesiastical Institution for the purpose of exciting in the mind of his diocesans the exalted idea which the Christians of former times bad of the holy season of Advent, and to the removing an erroneous opinion which prevailed in those parts, namely, that Advent only concerned Religious, and not the laity. He shows them, that such an opinion, unless it be limited to the two practices of fasting and abstinence, is strictly speaking, rash and scandalous, since it cannot be denied that, in the laws and usages of the universal Church, there exist special practices, having for their end the preparing the faithful for the great feast of the Birth of Jesus Christ.

The Greek Church still continues to observe the fast of Advent, though with much less rigour than that of Lent. It consists of forty days, beginning with the 14th of November, the day on which this Church keeps the feast of the Apostle St. Philip. During this entire period, the people abstain from flesh-meat, butter, milk, and eggs ; but they are allowed, which they are not during Lent, fish, oil, and wine. Fasting, in its strict sense, is only bind- ing on seven out of the forty days ; and the whole period goes under the name of St. Philip's Lent. The Greeks justify these relaxations by this distinction ; that the Lent before Christmas is, so they say, only an institution of the monks, whereas the Lent before Easter is of Apostolic institution.

28 ADVENT.

Bat, if the exterior practices of penance which for- merly sanctified the season of Advent, have been, in the Western Church, so gradually relaxed as to have become now quite obsolete except in monasteries ;l the general character of the Liturgy of this holy time has not changed; and it is by their zeal in foil owing its spirit, that the Faithful will prove their earnest- ness in preparing for Christmas.

The liturgical form of Advent as it now exists in the Roman Church, has gone through certain modi- fications. St. Gregory seems to have been the first to draw up the Office for this season, which originally included five Sundays, as is evident from the most ancient Sacramentaries of this great Pope. It even appears probable, and the opinion has been adopted by Amalarius of Metz, Berno of Bichenaw, Dom Martene, and Benedict the Fourteenth, that St. Gregory originated the ecclesiastical precept of Ad- vent, although the custom of devoting a longer or shorter period to a preparation for Christmas has been observed from time immemorial, and the absti- nence and fast of this holy season first began in France. St. Gregory therefore fixed, for the Churches of the Latin rite, the form of the Office for this Lent- like season, and sanctioned the fast which had been established, granting a certain latitude to the several Churches as to the manner of its observance.

The Sacramentary of St. Gelasius has neither Mass nor Office of preparation for Christmas; the first we meet with are in the Gregorian Sacramentary, and, as we just observed, these Masses are five in number. It is remarkable that these Sundays were then counted inversely, that is, the nearest to Christ- mas was called the first Sunday, and so on with the rest. So far back as the ninth and tenth centuries,

1 Our English observance of Fast and Abstinence on the Wed- nesdays and Fridays in Advent, may, in some sense, be regarded as a remnant of the ancient discipline. [Note of the Ti\~\

HISTOEY OF ADVENT. 29

these Sundays were reduced to four, as we learn from Amalarius, St. Nicholas the First, Berno of Richenaw, Ratherius of Verona, &c, and such also is their number in the Gregorian Sacramentary of Pamelius, which ap- pears to have been transcribed about this same period. From that time, the Roman Church has always ob- served this arrangement of Advent, which gives it four weeks, the fourth beings that in which Christmas Day falls, unless the 25th of December be a Sunday. We may therefore consider the present discipline of the observance of Advent as having lasted a thousand years, at least as far as the Church of Rome is con- cerned; for some of the Churches in France kept up the number of five Sundays as late as the thirteenth century.

The Ambrosian Liturgy, even to this day, has six weeks of Advent; so has the Gothic or Mozarabic Missal. As regards the Gallican Liturgy, the frag- ments collected by Dom Mabillon give us no informa- tion ; but it is natural to suppose with this learned man, whose opinion has been confirmed by Dom Marten e, that the Church of Gaul adopted, in this as in so many other points, the usages of the Gothic Church, that is to say, that its Advent consisted of six Sundays and six weeks.

With regard to the Greeks, their Rubrics for Ad- vent are given in the Mensea, immediately after the Office for the 14th of November. They have no proper Office for Advent, neither do they celebrate during this time the Mass of the Presanctified, as they do in Lent. There are only in the Offices for the Saints, whose feasts occur between the 14th of November and the Sunday nearest Christmas, fre- quent allusions to the Birth of the Saviour, to the Maternity of Mary, to the cave of Bethlehem, &c. On the Sunday preceding Christmas, in order to celebrate the expected coming of the Messias, they keep what they call the Feast of the Holy Fathers,

30 ADVENT.

that is the commemoration of the Saints of the Old Law. They give the name of Ante-Feast of the Nativity to" the 20th, 21st, 22nd, and 23rd December ; and although they say the office of several Saints on these four days, yet the mystery of the Birth of Jesus pervades the whole Liturgy.

CHAPTER THE SECOND.

THE MYSTEEY OF ADVENT.

If, now that we have described the characteristic features of Advent, which distinguish it from the rest of the year, we would penetrate into the profound mystery which occupies the mind of the Church during this season, we find that this mystery of the Coming, or Advent, of Jesus is at once simple and threefold. It is simple, for it is the one same Son of God that is coming; it is threefold, because he comes at three different times and in three different ways.

" In the first Coming," says St. Bernard, " he comes "in the flesh and in weakness; in the second, he " comes in spirit and in power ; in the third, he comes " in glory and in majesty ; and the second Coming is "the means whereby we pass from the first to the "third."1

This, then, is the mystery of Advent. Let us now listen to the explanation of this threefold visit of Christ, given to us by Peter of Blois, in his third Sermon de Adventu : " There are three Comings of " our Lord ; the first in the flesh, the second in the "soul, the third at the judgment. The first was at " midnight, according to those words of the Gospel : "At midnight there was a cry made, Lo the Bride- " groom cometh ! But this first Coming is long " since past, for Christ has been seen on the earth " and has conversed among men. We are now in " the second Coming, provided only we are such as " that he may thus come to us ; for he has said that " if we love him, he will come unto us and will take

1 Fifth Sermon for Advent.

32 ADVENT.

" up his abode with us. So that this second Coming " is full of uncertainty to us ; for who, save the Spirit " of God, knows them that are of God ? They that " are raised out of themselves by the desire of "heavenly things, know indeed when he comes ; but " whence he cometh, or whither he goeth, they know " not As for the third Coming, it is most certain " that it will be, most uncertain when it will be ; for "nothing is more sure than death, and nothing less " sure than the hour of death. When they shall say, " peace and security, says the Apostle, then shall " sudden destruction come upon them, as the pains " upon her that is with child, and they shall not " escape. So that the first Coming was humble and "hidden, the second is mysterious and full of love, the " third will be majestic and terrible. In his first " Coming, Christ was judged by men unjustly ; in his " second, he renders us just by his grace ; in his third, " he will judge all things with justice. In his first, a " Lamb ; in his last, a Lion ; in the one between the " two, the tenderest of Friends." -1

The holy Church, therefore, during Advent, awaits in tears and with ardour the arrival of her Jesus in his first Coming. For this, she borrows the fervid expressions of the Prophets, to which she joins her own supplications. These longings for the Messias expressed by the Church, are not a mere commemo- ration of the desires of the ancient Jewish people ; they have a reality and efficacy of their own, — an influence in the great act of God's munificence, whereby he gave us his own Son. From all eternity, the prayers of the ancient Jewish people and the prayers of the Christian Church ascended together to the prescient hearing of God ; and it was after receiving and granting them, that he sent, in the appointed time, that blessed dew upon the earth, which made it bud forth the Saviour. 1 De Adventu, Sermo III.

MYSTERY OF ADVENT. 33

The Church aspires also to the second Coming, the consequence of the first, which consists, as we have just seen, in the visit of the Bridegroom to the Spouse. This Coming takes place, each year, at the feast of Christmas, when the new birth of the Son of God delivers the faithful from that yoke of bondage, under which the enemy would oppress them.1 The Church, therefore, during Advent, prays that she may be visited by Him who is her Head and her Spouse ; visited in her hierarchy; visited in her members, of whom some are living, and some are dead, but may come to life again ; visited, lastly, in those who are not in communion with her, and even in the very infidels, that so they may be converted to the true light, which shines even for them. The expressions of the Liturgy which the Church makes use of to ask for this loving and invisible Coming, are those which she employs when begging for the coming of Jesus in the flesh; for the two visits are for the same object. In vain would the Son of God have come, eighteen hundred years ago, to visit and save mankind, unless he came again for each one of us and at every moment of our lives, bringing to us and cherishing within us that supernatural life, of which he and his Holy Spirit are the sole principle.

But this annual visit of the Spouse does not con- tent the Church ; she aspires after a third Coming, which will complete all things by opening the gates of eternity. She has caught up the last words of her Spouse, Surely, I am coming quickly ;2 and she cries out to him, Ah! Lord Jesus ! come !3 She is impatient to be loosed from her present temporal state ; she longs for the number of the elect to be filled up, and to see appear, in the clouds of heaven, the sign of her Deliverer and her Spouse. Her desires, expressed by her Advent Liturgy, go even as far as

1 Collect for Christmas Day. 2 Apoc. xxii. 20. 3 Ibid.

D

34 ADVENT.

this : and here we have the explanation of those words of the beloved Disciple in his prophecy : The nuptials of the Lamb are come, and his Spouse hath prepared herself}

But the day of this his last ComiDg to her, will be a day of terror. The Church frequently trembles at the very thought of that awful judgment, in which all mankind is to be tried. She calls it " a day of wrath, " on which, as David and the Sibyl have foretold, the " world will be reduced to ashes ; a day of weeping " and fear." Not that she fears for herself, since she knows that this day will for ever secure to her the crown, as being the Spouse of Jesus ; but her maternal heart is troubled at the thought that, on the same day, so many of her children will be on the left hand of the Judge, and, having no share with the elect, will be bound hand and foot, and cast into the darkness, where there shall be everlasting weeping and gnashing of teeth. This is the reason why the Church, in the Liturgy of Advent, so frequently speaks of the Com- ing of Christ as a terrible Coming, and selects from the Scriptures those passages, which are most calcu- lated to awaken a salutary fear in the mind of such of her children as may be sleeping the sleep of sin.

This, then, is the threefold mystery of Advent. The liturgical forms in which it is embodied, are of two kinds : the one consists of prayers, passages from the Bible, and similar formulas, in all of which, words themselves are employed to convey the sentiments which we have been explaining ; the other consists of external rites peculiar to this holy time, which, by speaking to the outward senses, complete the expressiveness of the chants and words.

First of all, there is the number of the days of Advent. Forty was the number originally adopted by the Church, and it is still maintained in the

1 Apoc. xix. 7.

MYSTERY OF ADVENT. 35

Ambrosian liturgy, and in the Eastern Church. If, at a later period, the Church of Rome, and those who follow her Liturgy, have changed the number of days, the same idea is still expressed in the four weeks which have been substituted for the forty days. The new Birth of our Redeemer takes place after four weeks, as the first Nativity happened after four thousand years, according to t)ie Hebrew and Yulgate Chronology.

As in Lent, so likewise during Advent, Marriage is not solemnised, lest worldly joy should distract Christians from those serious thoughts wherewith the expected Coming of the Sovereign Judge ought to inspire them, or from that dearly cherished hope which the friends of the Bridegroom1 have of being soon called to the eternal Nuptial-feast.

The people are forcibly reminded of the sadness which fills the heart of the Church by the sombre colour of the Vestments. Excepting on the Feasts of the Saints, purple is the only colour she uses ; the Deacon does not wear the Dalmatic, nor the Sub- deacon the Tunic. Formerly it wTas the custom, in some places, to wear Black Vestments. This mourn- ing of the Church shows how fully she unites herself with those true Israelites of old, who, clothed in sack- cloth and ashes, waited for the Messias, and bewailed Sion that she had not her beauty, and " Juda, that " the sceptre had been taken from him, till He should "come whowasto be sent, the expectation of nations."2 It also signifies the works of penance, whereby she prepares for the second Coming, full as it is of sweet- ness and mystery, which is realised in the souls of men, in proportion as they appreciate the tender love of that Divine Guest, who has said : My delights are to be with the children of men.3 It expresses, thirdly, the desolation of this Spouse wTho yearns after

1 St. John, iii. 29. 2 Gen. xlix. 10. 3 Prov. viii. 31.

36 ADVENT.

her Beloved, who is long a-coming. Like the turtle dove, she moans her loneliness, longing for the voice which will say to her : Come from Libanus, my Spouse ! come, thou shalt be crowned : — thou hast wounded my heart}

The Church also, during Advent, excepting on the Feasts of Saints, suppresses the Angelic Canticle, Gloria in excelsis Deo, et in terra pax hominibus bono3 voluntatis ; for this glorious Song was only sung at Bethlehem over the crib of the Divine Babe ; — the tongue of the Angels is not loosened yet ; — the Virgin has not yet brought forth her divine treasure ; — it is not yet time to sing, it is not even true to say, Glory be to God in the highest, and peace on earth to men of good will !

Again, at the end of Mass, the Deacon does not dismiss the assembly of the faithful by the words : Ite, Missa est. He substitutes the ordinary greeting : Benedicamus Domino I as though the Church feared to interrupt the prayers of the people, which could scarce be too long during these days of expectation.

In the Night Office, the Holy Church also suspends, on those same days, the hymn of jubilation, Te Deum laudamus. It is in deep humility that she awaits the supreme blessing which is to come to her; and in the interval, she presumes only to ask, and entreat, and hope. But let the glorious hour come, when, in the midst of darkest night, the Sun of Justice will suddenly rise upon the world, — then iudeed she will resume her hymn of thanksgiving, and all over the face of the earth, the silence of midnight will be broken by this shout of enthusiasm : " We praise thee, " O God ! we acknowledge thee to be our Lord ! Thou, " O Christ, art the King of glory, the everlasting Son " of the Father ! Thou, being to deliver man, didst " not disdain the Virgin's womb !"

iCant. iv. 8, 9.

MYSTEEY OF ADVENT. 37

On the Ferial Days, the Rubrics of Advent pre- scribe that certain prayers should be said kneeling, at the end of each Canonical Hour, and that the Choir should also kneel during a considerable portion of the Mass. In this respect, the usages of Advent are pre- cisely the same as those of Lent.

But there is one feature winch distinguishes Ad- vent most markedly from Lent : the word of gladness, the joyful Alleluia, is not interrupted during Advent, except once or twice during the ferial office. It is sung in the Masses of the four Sundays, and vividly contrasts with the sombre colour of the Vestments. On one of these Sundays — the third — the prohibition of using the organ is removed, and we are gladdened by its grand notes, and rose-coloured Vestments may be used instead of the purple. These vestiges of joy, thus blended with the holy mournfulness of the Church, tell us, in a most expressive way, that though she unites with the ancient people of God in praying for the coming of the Messias, (thus paying the debt which the entire human race owes to the justice and mercy of God,) she does not forget that the Emmanuel is already come to her, that he is in her, and that even before she has opened her lips to ask him to save her, she has been already redeemed and predestined to an eternal union with him. This is the reason why the Alleluia accompanies even her sighs, and why she seems to be at once joyous and sad, waiting for the coming of that holy night which will be brighter to her than the most sunny of days, and on which her joy will expel all her sorrow.

CHAPTER THE THIKD.

PRACTICE DURING ADVENT.

If our holy mother the Church spends the time of Advent in this solemn preparation for the threefold Coming of Jesus Christ ; if, after the example of the prudent Virgins, she keeps her lamp lit ready for the coming of the Bridegroom ; we, being her members and her children, ought to enter into her spirit, and apply to ourselves this warning of our Saviour : Let your loins be girt, and lamps burning in your hands, and ye yourselves be like unto men who wait for their Lord I1 The Church and we have, in reality, the same hopes. Each one of us is, on the part of God, an object of mercy and care as is the Church herself. If she is the temple of God, it is because she is built of living stones ; if she is the Spouse, it is because she consists of all the souls which are invited to eternal anion with God. If it is written that the Saviour hath purchased the Church with his own Blood? may not each one of us say of himself those words of St. Paul, Christ hath loved me, and hath delivered himself up for me f Our destiny being the same, then, as that of the Church, we should endeavour during Advent, to enter into the spirit of preparation, wThich is, as we have seen, that of the Church herself.

And firstly, it is our duty to join with the Saints of the Old Law in asking for the Messias, and thus pay the debt which the whole human race owes to the divine mercy. In order to fulfil this duty with fervour, let us go back in thought to those four

1 St. Luke, xii. 35. 2 Acts, xx. 28. 3 Gal. ii. 20.

PRACTICE DURING ADVENT. 39

thousand years, represented by the four -weeks of Advent, and reflect on the darkness and crime which filled the world before our Saviour's cominsr. Let our hearts be filled with lively gratitude towards Him who saved his creature Man from death, and who came down from heaven that he might know our miseries by himself experiencing them, yes, all of them, excepting sin. Let us cry to him with con- fidence from the depths of our misery; for, notwith- standing his having saved the work of his hands, he still wishes us to beseech him to save us. Let there- fore our desires and our confidence have their free utterance in the ardent supplications of the ancient Prophets, which the Church puts on our lips during these days of expectation; let us give our closest attention to the sentiments which they express.

This first duty complied with, we must next turn our minds to the Coming which our Saviour wishes to accomplish in our own hearts. It is, as we have seen, a Coming full of sweetness and mystery, and a consequence of the first ; for the Good Shepherd comes not only to visit the flock in general, but he extends his solicitude to each one of the sheep, even to the hundredth which is lost. Now, in order to appreciate the whole of this ineffable mystery, we must remember that, since we can only be pleasing to our Heavenly Father inasmuch as he sees within us his Son Jesus Christ, this amiable Saviour deigns to come into each one of us, and transform us, if we will but consent, into himself, so that henceforth we may live, not we, but he in us. This is, in reality, the one grand aim of the Christian Religion, to make man divine through Jesus Christ : it is the task which God has given to his Church to do, and she says to the faithful what St. Paul said to his Gala tians : My little children, of whom I am in labour again, until Christ be formed within you!1

1 Gal. i\r. 19?

40 - ADVENT.

But, as on his entering into this world, our divine Saviour first showed himself under the form of a weak Babe, before attaining the fulness of the age of manhood, and this to the end that nothing might be wanting to his sacrifice, — so does he intend to do in us ; there is to be a progress in his growth within us. Now, it is at the feast of Christmas that he delights to be born in our souls, and that he pours out over the whole. Church a grace of being born, to which, however, all are not faithful.

For, this glorious solemnity, as often as it comes round, finds three classes of men. The first, and the smallest number, are they who live, in all its pleni- tude, the life of Jesus who is within them, and aspire incessantly after the increase of this life. The second class of souls is more numerous ; they are living, it is true, because Jesus is in them ; but they are sick and weakly, because they care not to grow in this divine life : their charity has become cold I1 The rest of men make up the third division, and are they who have no part of this life in them, and are dead ; for Christ has said : "J am the Life/'2

Now, during the season of Advent, our Lord knocks at the door of all men's hearts, at one time so forcibly, that they must needs notice him ; at another, so softly that it requires attention to know that Jesus is asking admission. He comes to ask them if they have room for him, for he wishes to be born in their house. The house indeed is his, for he built it and preserves it ; yet he complains that his own refused to receive him;3 at least the greater number did. But as many as received him, he gave them power to be made the sons of God, born not of blood, nor of the flesh, but of God*

He will be born, then, with more beauty and lustre and might than you have hitherto seen in

PRACTICE DURING ADVENT. 41

him, O ye faithful ones, who hold him within you as your only treasure, and who have long lived no other life than his, shaping your thoughts and works on the model of his. You will feel the necessity of words to suit and express your love; such words as he delights to hear you speak to him. You will find them in the holy Liturgy.

You, who have had him within you, without knowing him, and have possessed him without re- lishing the sweetness of his presence, open your hearts to welcome him, this time, with more care and love. He repeats his visit of this year with an untiring tenderness ; he has forgotten your past slights ; he would " that all things be new."1 Make room for the Divine Infant, for he desires to grow within your soul. The time of his coming is close at hand : let your heart, then, be on the watch ; and lest you should* slumber when he arrives, watch and pray, yea, sing. The words of the Liturgy are in- tended also for your use : they speak of darkness, which only God can enlighten ; of wounds, which only his mercy can heal ; of a faintness, which can only be braced by his divine energy.

And you, Christians, for whom the good tidings are as things that are not, because you are dead in sin, lo ! He who is very life is coining among you. Yes, whether this death of sin has held you as its slave for long years, or has but freshly inflicted on you the wound which made you its victim,— Jesus, your Life, is coming : why, then, will you die ? He desireth not the death of the sinner, but rather that he be converted and live.2 The grand Feast of his Birth will be a day of mercy for the whole world ; at least, for all who will give him admission into their hearts : they will rise to life again in him, their past life will be destroyed,

1 Apoc. xxi. 5. 2 Ezech. xviii. 31-5.

42 ADVENT.

and where sin abounded, there grace will more abound.1

But, if the tenderness and the attractiveness of this mysterious Coming make no impression on you, because your heart is too weighed down to be able to rise to confidence, and because, having so long drunk sin like water, you know not what it is to long with love for the caresses of a Father whom you have slighted, — then turn your thoughts to that other Coming, which is full of terror, and is to follow the silent one of grace that is now offered. Think within yourselves, how this earth of ours will tremble at the approach of the dread Judge ; how the heavens will flee from before his face, and fold up as a book f how man will wince under his angry look ; how the creature will wither away with fear, as the two-edged sword, which comes from the mouth of his Creator,3 pierces him; and how sinners will cry out, Ye mountains, fall on us ! ye rocks, cover us /* Those unhappy souls who would not know the time of their visitation, b shall then vainly wish to hide themselves from the face of Jesus. They shut their hearts against this Man-God, who, in his excessive love for them, wept over them ; — therefore, on the day of judgment they will descend alive into those everlasting fires, whose flame devoureth the earth with her increase, and burneth the foundations of the mountains.6 The worm that never dieth,7 the useless eternal repentance, will gnaw them for ever.

Let those, then, who are not touched by the tid- ings of the Coming of the Heavenly Physician and the Good Shepherd who giveth his life for his sheep, meditate during Advent on the awful yet certain truth, that so many render the redemption unavail- able to themselves by their refusing to co-operate in

their own salvation. They may treat the Child ivho is to be born1 with disdain ; but he is also the Mighty God, and do they think they can withstand him on that Day, when he is to come, not to save, as now, but to judge 1 Would that they knew more of this divine Judge, before whom the 'Tery Saints tremble ! Let them also use the Liturgy of this season, and they will there learn how much he is to be feared by sinners.

We would not imply by this that only sinners need to fear : no, every Christian ought to fear. Fear, when there is no nobler sentiment with it, makes man a slave; when it accompanies love, it is a feel- ing which fills the heart of a child who has offended his father, yet seeks for pardon; when, at length, love casteth out fear,2 even then this holy fear will sometimes come, and, like a flash of lightning, per- vade the deepest recesses of the soul. It does the soul good. She wakes up afresh to a keener sense of her own misery and of the unmerited mercy of her Redeemer. Let no one, therefore, think that he may safely pass his Advent without taking any share in the holy fear which animates the Church. She, though so beloved by God, prays to him to give her this fear ; and every day, in her Office of Sext, she thus cries out to him : Pierce my flesh with thy Fear. It is, however, to those who are beginning a good life, that this part of the Advent Liturgy will be peculiarly serviceable.

It is evident from what we have said, that Advent is a season specially devoted to the exercises of what is called the Purgative Life, and which is implied in that expression of St. John, so continually repeated by the Church during this holy -time: Prepare ye the way of the Lord ! Let all, therefore, strive earnestly to make straight the path by which Jesus

Is. ix. 6. 2 1. St. John, iv. 18.

44 ADVENT.

will enter into their souls. Let the just, agreeably to the teaching of the Apostle, forget the things that are behind,1 and labour to acquire fresh merit. Let sinners begin at once and break the chains which now enslave them. Let them give up those bad habits which they have contracted. Let them weaken the flesh, and enter upon the hard work of subject- ing it to the spirit. Let them, above all things, pray with the Church. And when our Lord comes, they may hope that he will not pass them by, but that he will enter and dwell within them : for he spoke of all when he said these words : Behold, I stand at the gate and knock: if any man shall hear my voice and open to me the door, I will come in unto him.2

CHAPTER THE FOURTH.

MORNING AND NIGHT PRAYERS FOR ADVENT.

During Advent, the Christian, on waking in the morning, will unite himself with the Church, who, in her Office of Matins, says to us these solemn words, which choirs of religious men and women, throughout the universe, have been chanting during the deep silence of the night : —

Come, let us adore the Regem venturum Domi- King our Lord, who is to num, venite, adoremus. come !

He will profoundly adore this great King, whose Coming is so near at hand : and with this idea deeply impressed upon his mind, he will perform the first acts of religion, both interior and exterior, where- with he begins the day. The time for Morning Prayer being come, he may use the following me- thod, which is formed upon the very prayers of the Church : —

MORNING PRAYERS.

First, praise and adoration of the Most Holy Trinity :—

"ft. Let us bless the Father, $". Benedicamus Patrem,et

and the Son, and the Holy Filium, cum Sancto Spiritu. Ghost.

I£. Let us praise him and 1^. Laudemus et superex-

extol him above all for ever, altemus eum in ssecula.

J. Glory be to the Father, $\ Gloria Patri et Filio et

and to the Son, and to the Spiritui Sancto. Holy Ghost.

I£. As it was in the begin- I£. Sicut erat in principio,

ning, is now, and ever shall be, et nunc et semper, et in sse-

world without end. Amen. cula steculorum. Amen.

46 ADVENT.

Then, praise to our Lord and Saviour, Jesus Christ :—

ft. Adoranras te, Christe, ft. We adore thee, 0 Christ,

et benedicimus tibi. and we bless thee.

J$. Quia per Crucem tuam 1$. Because by thy Cross

redemisti mundum thou hast redeemed the world.

Thirdly, invocation of the Holy Ghost : —

Veni, Sancte Spiritus, re- Come, O Holy Spirit, fill

pie tuorum corda fidelium, the hearts of thy faithful,

et tui amoris in eis ignem and enkindle within them

accende. the fire of thy love.

After these fundamental acts of religion, you will recite the Lord's Prayer, asking of God, the Father of our Lord Jesus Christ, to grant that his holy Name may be glorified on earth by sending his Son, who will found the kingdom of God; and that he will vouchsafe to give us this Saviour who is our Bread, and who will obtain for us, by the mediation so long looked for, the forgiveness of our sins ; finally, that he will deliver us from sin, which is the sove- reign evil.

THE LORD'S PEAYEK.

Pater noster, qui es in Our Father, who art in

ccelis, sanctificetur nomen heaven, hallowed be thy

tuum : adveniat regnum tu- name : thy kingdom come :

nm : fiat voluntas tua, sicut thy will be done, on earth,

in ccelo, et in terra. Panem as it is in heaven. Give us

nostrum quoticlianum da no- this day our daily bread ;

bis hodie : et dimitte nobis and forgive us our trespasses,

debita nostra, sicut et nos as we forgive them that tres-

dimittimus debitoribus nos- pass against us : and lead us

tris : et ne nos inducas in not into temptation : but de-

tentationem : sed libera nos liver us from evil. Amen, a malo. Amen.

Then address the Angelical Salutation to Mary, who is, in these days which precede the Nativity, so truly full of grace, since she has in her chaste womb Him who is the author of all grace. The Lord, the

MOKNING PRAYERS.

47

fruit of her womb, is with her ; and we may already give her the sublime and unshared title of Mother of God

THE ANGELICAL SALUTATION.

Hail Mary, full of grace ; the Lord is with thee ; bles- sed art thou among women, and blessed is the fruit of thy womb, Jesus.

Holy Mary, Mother of God, pray for us sinners, now and at the hour of our death. Amen.

Ave Maria, gratia plena : Dominus tecum : benedicta tu in muheribus, et bene- dictus fructus ventris tui, Jesus.

Sancta Maria, Mater Dei, ora pro nobis peccatoribus, nunc et in hora mortis nos- tras. Amen.

After this, recite the symbol of Faith ; and as you pronounce the words, Who was conceived by the Holy Ghost, dwell on them with a special attention, adoring the Saviour, who is as yet concealed in Mary's womb.

THE APOSTLES CREED.

I believe in God the Father Almighty, Creator of heaven and earth. And in Jesus Christ, his only Son, our Lord, ivho was conceived by the Holy Ghost, born of the Virgin Mary ; suffered under Pon- tius Pilate, was crucified, dead, and buried ; he de- scended into hell, the third day he rose again from the dead ; he ascended into hea- ven, sitteth at the right hand of God the Father Almighty ; from thence he shall come to judge the living and the dead.

I believe in the Holy Ghost : the Holy Catholic Church ; the communion of Saints, the forgiveness of sins, the resur- rection of the body, and life everlasting. Amen.

Credo in Deum, Patrem omnipotentem, creatorem cceli et terras. Et in Jesum Christum Filium ejus uni- cum Dominum nostrum : qui conceptus est de Spiritu Sancto, natus ex Maria Vir- gine, passus sub Pontio Pi- lato, crucifixus, mortuus, et sepultus : descendit ad in- feros, tertia die resurrexit a mortuis : ascendit ad coelos, sedet ad dexteram Dei Patris omnipotentis : inde venturus est j udicare vivos et mortuos.

Credo in Spiritum Sanc- tum, sanctam Ecclesiam Ca- tholicam. Sanctorum commu- nionem, remissionem pecca- torum, carnis resurrectionem, vitam seternam. Amen,

48

ADVENT.

After having thus made the Profession of your Faith, excite within yourself sentiments of penance, by the remembrance of the sins you have committed ; of gratitude to the Lamb of God, who is coming in order to save us ; and of fear of the Last Day. For this end, say with the Church the following hymn, taken from the Office of Lauds for Advent.

HYMN.

En clara vox redarguit, Obscura quaeque personalis ; Procul fugentur somnia : Ab alto Jesus promicat.

Mens jam resurgat torpida, ISTon amplius jacens humi : Sidus reiulget jam novum, Ut tollat omne noxium.

En Agnus ad nos mittitur Laxare gratis debitum : Omnes simul cum lacrymis, Precemur indulgentiam.

Ut cum secundo fulserit Metuque mundum cinxerit, Non pro reatu puniat, Sed nos pius tunc protegat.

Virtus, honor, laus, gloria, Deo Patri cum Filio, Sancto simul Paraclito, In sseculorum sascula.

Amen.

The solemn voice of the Precursor is heard, explain- ing the obscurity of the ancient figures ; let our slum- bers cease ; Jesus is rising on our horizon.

f Let the sluggish soul now rise, and stay no more upon this earth ; a new star is shining, which will take all sin away.

Lo ! the Lamb is sent to forgive us freely our debt : let us unite in tears and prayers, that we may obtain pardon.

That when he comes the second time, filling the world with fear, he may not have to punish us for our sins, but may protect us in mercy.

Power, honour, praise, and glory, be to the Father, and to the Son, and to the Holy Paraclete, for ever and ever. Amen.

Here make an humble confession of your sins, reciting the general formula made use of by the Church.

THE CONFESSION OF SINS.

Confiteor Deo omnipotent, I confess to Almighty God, beatse Marise semper Vir- to blessed Mary ever Virgin, gini, beato Michaeli Arch- to blessed Michael the Arch-

angel, to Blessed John Bap- tist, to the holy Apostles Peter and Paul, and to all the saints, that I have sinned exceedingly in thought, word, and deed : through my fault, through my fault, through my most grievous fault. Therefore I beseech the Blessed Mary ever Virgin, blessed Michael the Arch- angel, blessed John Baptist, the holy Apostles Peter and Paul, and all the saints, to pray to our Lord God for me.

May Almighty God have mercy on us, and, our sins being forgiven, bring us to life everlasting. Amen.

May the Almighty and merciful Lord grant us par- don, absolution, and remis- sion of our sins.

angelo, beato Joanni Bap- tists, Sanctis Apostolis Petro et Paulo, et omnibus Sanctis, quia peccavi nimis cogita- tione, verbo, et opere : mea culpa, mea culpa, mea max- ima culpa. Ideo precor beatam Mariam semper Yir- ginem, beatum Michaelem Archangelum, beatum Joan- nem Baptistam, sanctos Apos- tolos Petrum et Paulum, et omnes sanctos, orare pro me ad Dominum Deum nostrum.

Misereatur nostri omnipo- tens Deus, et dimissis pec- catis nostris, perducat nos ad vitam seternam. Amen.

Indulgentiam, absolutio- nem, et remissionem pecca- torum nostrorum tribuat nobis omnipotens et miseri- cors Dominus. Amen.

This is the proper place for making your Medita- tion, as no doubt you practise this holy exercise. During Advent, its principal object ought to be the removing from ourselves those hindrances, which would oppose Jesus' coming and reigning within us. The love of sensual pleasures, avarice, and pride, that triple concupiscence which St. John so strongly con- demns in his first Epistle, must be withstood, else our preparation for Christmas is useless. And as the chief thing in every Prayer or Meditation, is to turn our thoughts to Jesus Christ, we must, during Advent, contemplate him in the womb of Mary, where he remains hidden, giving us, by this his state of abasement, a most telling lesson of devotedness to his Father's glory, of obedience to the divine decrees, and of humility ; but, at the same time, he gives us a most powerful proof of the greatness of his love of us.

50 ADVENT.

This thought will naturally suggest to us a variety of motives and resolutions for breaking those ties which keep us from a virtuous life. But should they not produce sufficient impression on us, we must then consider Jesus as oar Judge, in the dread magnifi- cence of his majesty, and all the severity of his in- evitable vengeance.

The next part of your Morning Prayer must be to ask of God, by the following prayers, grace to avoid every kind of sin during the day you are just begin- ning. Say, then, with the Church, whose prayers must always be preferred to all others :

$". Domine, exaudi ora- $\ 0 Lord, hear my prayer, tionem meam.

~f$. Et clamor meus ad te I£. And let my cry come

veniat. unto thee.

OREMXJS. LET US PRAY.

Then, beg the divine assistance for the actions of the day, that you may do them well ; and say thrice :

"ft. Deus, in adjutorium $". Incline unto my aid, O

1$. Amen.

After this, uniting yourself with the Church, which, both in the Divine Office, and during the Holy Sa- crifice, prays for the coming of Jesus Christ, say :

ft. Veni ad liberandum nos, Domine Deus virtutum.

I£. Ostende faciem tuam, et salvi erimus.

It would be well to add the special Prayer, which the Church says, during Advent, in honour of the Blessed Mother of God.

During the day, you may use the instructions and prayers which you will find in this volume for each day of .Advent, both for the Proper of the Time, and the Proper of the Saints. In the evening, you may use the following prayers.

NIGHT PRATERS,

After having made the sign of the Cross, adore the Divine Majesty, who has so mercifully preserved you during this day, and so plentifully bestowed upon you, every hour, his grace and protection. Begin by re- citing the hymn which the Church sings at Vespers during Advent

After this Hymn, say the Our Father, the Hail Mary, and the Apostles' Greed, as in the Morning.

Then make the Examination of Conscience, going over in your mind all the faults you may have com- mitted during the day ; think how unworthy sin makes us of the merciful visit of our Saviour, and make a firm resolution to avoid sin for the future, to do penance for it, and to avoid the occasions which might lead you into it.

The Examination of Conscience concluded, recite the Confiteor (or I confess) with heartfelt contrition, and then give expression to your sorrow by the fol- lowing Act, which we have taken from the Venerable Cardinal Bellarmine's Catechism :

ACT OF CONTRITION.

O my God, I am exceedingly grieved for having offended thee, and with my whole heart 1 repent for the sins I have committed : I hate and abhor them above every other evil, not only because, by so sinning, I have lost Heaven and deserved Hell, but still more because I have offended thee, O Infinite Goodness, who art worthy to be loved above all things. I most firmly resolve, by the assistance of thy grace, never more to offend thee for the time to come, and to avoid those occasions which might lead me into sin.

You may then add the Acts of Faith, Hope, and Charity, to the recitation of which Pope Benedict XIV. has granted an indulgence of seven years and seven quarantines for each time.

ACT OF FAITH.

O my God, I firmly believe whatsoever the Holy Catholic Apostolic Roman Church requires me to believe : I believe

55

it, because thou hast revealed it to her, thou who art the very- Truth.

ACT OF HOPE.

O my God, knowing thy almighty power, and thy infinite goodness and mercy,! hope in thee that, by the merits of the Passion and Death of our Saviour Jesus Christ, thou wilt grant me eternal life, which thou hast promised to all such as shall do the works of a good Christian ; and these I resolve to do with the help of thy grace.

ACT OF CHARITY.

0 my God, I love thee with my whole heart and above all things, because thou art the Sovereign Good : I would rather lose all things than offend thee. For thy love also, I love and desire to love my neighbour as myself.

Then say to our Blessed Lady, in honour of the ineffable dignity of her Maternity, the following Anthem :

ANTHEM TO THE BLESSED VIRGIN.

Sweet Mother of our Re- deemer^ Gate whereby we enter heaven, and Star of the sea ! help us, we fall ; yet do we long to rise. Nature looked upon thee with admi- ration, when thou didst give birth to thy divine Creator, thyself remaining, before and after it, a pure Virgin.

This done, remember the necessities of the Church Suffering, and beg of God that he will give to the souls in Purgatory a place of refreshment, light, and peace. For this intention recite the usual prayers.

PSALM 129.

From the depths I have cried to thee, O Lord ; Lord, hear my voice.

Let thine ears be attentive to the voice of my supplica- tion.

CHAPTER THE FIFTH.

ON HEARING MASS DURING THE TIME OF ADVENT.

There is no exercise which is more pleasing to God, or more meritorious, or which has greater influence in infusing solid piety into the soul, than the assist- ing at the holy Sacrifice of the Mass. If this be true at all the various seasons of the Christian Year, it is so, in a very especial manner, during the holy time of Advent. The Faithful, therefore, should make every effort in order to enjoy this precious blessing, even on those days when they are not obliged to it by the precept of the Church.

With what gratitude ought they not to assist at that divine Sacrifice, for which the world had been longing for four thousand years ! God has granted them to be born after the fulfilment of that stupendous and merciful oblation, and would not put them in the generations of men, who died before they could par- take of its reality and its riches ! This notwith- standing, they must earnestly unite with the Church, in praying for the coming of the Redeemer, so to pay their share of that great debt which God has put upon all, whether living before or after the fulfilment of the mystery of the Incarnation. Let them think of this in assisting at the holy Sacrifice.

Let them also remember, that this great Sacrifice, which perpetuates on this earth, even to the end of time, though in an unbloody manner, the real obla- tion of the Body and Blood of Jesus Christ, has this for its express aim, — to prepare the souls of the Faith- ful for the mysterious coming of God, who only re- deemed our souls that he might take possession of

MASS. 63

them. It not only prepares, it even effects this glorious Advent.

Let them, in the third place, lovingly profit by the presence of, and intimacy with, Jesus, to which this hidden yet saving mystery admits them; that so, when he comes in that other way, whereby he will judge the world in terrible majesty, he may recog- nise them as his friends, and even then, when mercy shall give place to justice, again save them.

We will now endeavour to embody these sentiments in our explanation of the Mysteries of the holy Mass, and initiate the Faithful into these divine secrets ; not, indeed, by indiscreetly presuming to translate the sacred formulae, but by suggesting such Acts, as will enable those who hear Mass, to enter into the cere- monies and sentiments of the Church and the Priest.

The Faithful, in assisting at Mass during Advent, should first know whether it is going to be said ac- cording to the Advent rite, or in honour of the Blessed Virgin, or of a Saint, or, finally, for the Dead. The colour of the Vestments worn by the Priest will tell them all this. Purple is used, if the Mass be of Advent ; white or red, if of our Lady or the Saints ; and black, if for the Dead. If the Priest be vested in purple, the Faithful must excite within themselves the spirit of penance, which the Church would signify by this colour. They should do the same, no matter what may be the colour of the Vestments ; for in every Mass during Advent, with the exception of Masses for the Dead, the Priest is obliged, even on the greatest feasts, to make a commemoration of Advent three separate times ; and thus to make use of the same expressions of repentance and sorrow as he would in a Mass proper to the time of Advent.

On the Sundays, if the Mass at which they assist be the Parochial, or, as it is often called, the Public Mass, two solemn rites precede it, which are full of

G4

ADVENT.

instruction and blessing, — the Asperges, or sprinkling of the Holy Water, and the Procession.

During the Asperges, let them ask for that purity of heart, which is necessary for the having a share in the twofold Coming of Jesus Christ; and in receiving the Holy Water, the sprinkling of which prepares us for the assisting worthily at the great Sacrifice, wherein is poured forth, not a figurative water, but the very Blood of the Lamb, they should think of that Baptism of water, by means of which St. John the Baptist prepared the Jews for that other Baptism, which the power and mercy of the Bedeemer were afterwards to give to mankind.

antiphon OF the Asperges.

Asperges me, Domine, hyssopo, et mundabor ; lava- bis me, et super nivem deal- babor.

The Procession, which immediately precedes the Mass, should remind us how we ought to be stand- ing with lamps burning in our hands, ready to go out and meet our Lord, who is coming.1 The Church is ever advancing towards her Spouse in an unbroken procession, and our souls should be ever hastening towards their Sovereign Good, never resting until they have found him.

But see, Christians, the Sacrifice begins ! The Priest is at the foot of the altar ; God is attentive, the Angels are in adoration, the whole Church is united with the Priest, whose priesthood and action are those of the great High Priest, Jesus Christ. Let us make the sign of the cross with him.

THE ORDINARY OF THE MASS.

In the name of the Father, and of the Son, and of the Holy Ghost Amen.

I unite myself, O my God, with thy Church, who comes to seek consolation in Jesus Christ thy Son, who is the true Altar.

Like her, I beseech thee to defend me against the malice of the enemies of my salva- tion.

It is in thee that I have put my hope ; yet do I feel sad and troubled at being in the midst of the snares which are set for me.

Send me, then, him who is light and truth ; it is he that will open to us the way to thy holy mount, to thy heavenly tabernacle.

He is the Mediator and the living Altar ; I will draw nigh to him, an d be filled with

joy.

When he shall have come, I will sing in my gladness. Be not sad, O my soul ! why wouldst thou be troubled ]

Hope in his Coming ; he who is thy Saviour and thy God, will soon be with thee.

Glory be to the Father, and to the Son, and to the Holy Ghost.

As it was in the beginning, is now, and ever shall be, world without end. Amen.

I am to go to the altar of God, and feel the presence of him who consoles me !

This my hope comes not from any merits of my own, but from the all-powerful help of my Creator.

This announcement of the Coming of our Lord, excites in the soul of the Priest a lively sentiment of compunction. He cannot go further in the holy Sacrifice without confessing, and publicly, that he is a sinner, and deserves not the grace he is about to receive. Listen, with respect, to this confession of God's Minister, and earnestly ask our Lord to show mercy to him ; for the Priest is your Father ; he is answerable for your salvation, for which he every day risks his own. When he has finished, unite with the Servers, or the Sacred Ministers, in this prayer :

Misereatur tui omnipotens Deus, et dimissis peccatis

May Almighty God have mercy on thee, and, forgiving

67

thy sins, bring thee to ever- lasting life.

tuis, perducat te ad vitam seternam.

The Priest having answered Amen, make your confession, saying with a contrite spirit :

I confess to Almighty God, to Blessed Mary ever Virgin, to blessed Michael the Arch- angel, to blessed John Bap- tist, to the"holy Apostles Peter and Paul, to all the saints, and to thee, Father, that I have sinned exceedingly in thought, word, and deed, through my fault, through my fault, through my most grievous fault. Therefore, I beseech the Blessed Mary ever Virgin, blessed Michael the Archangel, blessed John Baptist, the holy Apostles Peter and Paul, and all the saints, and thee, Father, to pray to our Lord God for

ConfiteorDeo omnipotenti, beatse Marias semper Virgini, beato Michaeli Archangelo, beato Joanni Baptistae, Sanc- tis Apostolis Petro et Paulo, omnibus Sanctis, et tibi, Pater : quia peccavi nimis cogitatione, verbo, et opere : mea culpa, mea culpa, mea maxima culpa. Ideo precor beatam Mariam semper Vir- ginem, beatum Michaelem Archangelum, beatum Joan- nem Baptistam, sanctos Apostolos Petrum et Paulum, omnes sanctos, et te, Pater, orare pro me ad Dominum Deum nostrum.

Receive with gratitude the paternal wish of the Priest, who says to you :

Misereatur vestri omnipo- tens Deus, et dimissis pec- catis vestris, perducat vos ad vitam seternam.

I£. Amen.

Iadulgentiam, absolutio- nem, et remissionem pec- catorum nostrorum, tribuat nobis omnipotens et iniseri- cors Dominus.

Invoke the divine assistance, that you may ap- proach to Jesus Christ.

The Priest here leaves you to ascend to the altar; but first he salutes you:

ft. Dominus vobiscum. ft. The Lord be with you.

Answer him with reverence :

]$. Et cum spiritu tuo. 1$. And with thy spirit.

OEEMUS.

LET US PEAY.

He ascends the steps, and conies to the Holy of Holies. Ask, both for him and yourself, the deliver- ance from sin.

Aufer a nobis, qusesumus Domine, iniquitates nostras ; ut ad Sancta sanctorum puris mereamur mentibus introire. Per Christum Dominum nos- trum. Amen.

Take from our hearts, O Lord, all those sins, which make us unworthy of thy visit ; we ask this of thee by thy divine Son, our Lord.

When the Priest kisses the altar, out of reverence for the relics of the Martyrs which are there, say :

Generous soldiers of Jesus Christ, who have mingled your own blood with his, in- tercede for us that our sins may be forgiven ; that so we may, like you, approach unto God.

If it be a High Mass at which you are assisting, the Priest incenses the Altar in a most solemn man-

Oramus te, Domine, per merita sanctorum tuorum quorum reliquiae hie sunt, et omnium Sanctorum : ut in- dulgere digneris omnia pec- cata mea. Amen.

THE ORDINARY OF THE MASS. 69

ner ; and this white cloud which you see ascending from every part of the Altar, signifies the prayer of the Church, who addresses herself to Jesus Christ ; and which this Divine Mediator then causes to ascend, united with his own, to the throne of the majesty of his Father.

The Priest then says the Introit. In the Masses proper to Advent, it is a cry made to the Messias, which has so much the greater power with God, as it goes up to him from the holy Altar.

It is followed by nine exclamations, which are even more earnest, for they ask for mercy. In addressing them to God, the Church unites herself with the nine choirs of Angels, who are standing round the altar of Heaven, one and the same as this before which you are kneeling.

To the Father, who is to send us Ms Son :

Lord, have mercy on us ! Kyrie eleison.

Lord, have mercy on us ! Kyrie eleison.

Lord, have mercy on us ! Kyrie eleison.

To the Son, who is to come to us :

Christ, have mercy on us ! Christe eleison.

Christ, have mercy on us ! Christe eleison.

Christ, have mercy on us ! Christe eleison.

To the Holy Ghost, ivhose operation is to accomplish the mystery: *

Lord, have mercy on us ! Kyrie eleison.

Lord, have mercy on us ! Kyrie eleison.

Lord, have mercy on us ! Kyrie eleison.

If it be a Feast, the Priest says the Angelic Hymn, which the Church has made her own ever since the Birth of our Saviour : if the Mass be proper to Advent, the Church forbids the joyous Canticle until the New Birth of her spouse again comes to gladden her.

70

ADVENT,

THE ANGELIC HYMN.

Glory be to God on high, and on earth peace to men of good will.

We praise thee : we bless thee : we adore thee : we glorify thee : we give thee thanks for thy great glory.

O Lord God, Heavenly King, God the Father Al- mighty.

O Lord Jesus Christ, the Only Begotten Son.

O Lord God, Lamb of God, Son of the Father.

Who takest away the sins of the world, have mercy on us.

Who takest away the sins of the world, receive our humble prayer.

Who sittest at the right hand of the Father, have mercy on us.

For thou alone art holy, thou alone art Lord, thou alone, O Jesus Christ, to- gether with the Holy Ghost, art most high, in the glory of God the Father. Amen.

The Priest turns towards the people, and again salutes them, as it were to make sure of their pious attention to the sublime act, for which all this is but the preparation. The words of this greeting are especially beautiful during the weeks of Advent: The Lord be with you ! Isaias had foretold that it would indeed be verified, and the Angel confirms the prophecy to St. Joseph, when he thus says to him : " He shall be called Emmanuel, that is, God vrith us."}

1 St. Matth. i. 23.

Gloria in excelsis Deo, et in terra pax hominibus bonae voluntatis.

Laudamus te : benediei- miis te : adoramus te : glori- ficamus te : gratiaa agimus tibi propter magnam gioriam tuam.

Quoniam tu solus sanctus, tu solus Dominus, tu solus Altissimus, Jesu Christe, cum Sancto Spiritu, in gloria Dei Patris. Amen.

THE ORDINARY OF THE MASS. 71

Then follows the Collect or Prayer, in which the Church formally expresses to the divine Majesty the special intentions she has in the Mass which is being celebrated. You may unite in this prayer, by recit- ing with the Priest the Collects which you will find in their proper places : but on no account omit to join with the server of the Mass in answering Amen.

Then follows the Epistle, which is, generally, a por- tion of one or other of the Epistles of the Apostles, or a passage from some Book of the Old Testament. Listen to this word of God's Messengers with respect and submission, and long for Him who is the eternal Word, and who is soon to be born among men and converse with them.

The Gradual is an intermediate formula of prayer between the Epistle and Gospel. It again brings to our attention the sentiments which were expressed in the Introit. Read it with devotion, so as to get more and more into the spirit of preparation for the coming of your Saviour.

The Alleluia is like a thrill of joy, which seizes the soul of the Church, and makes her exult, as she reflects that she already possesses the Spouse, of whom she is in expectation ; but this is only for a moment ; — she resumes her attitude of a suppliant, asking him to come, for she feels that she needs his new coming.

Until the happy hour when he will come in per- son, he comes to us by his words, which are spirit and life. The Gospel is about to be read aloud in the assembly of the faithful ; the poor are to have the gospel preached unto them. If it be a High Mass, the Deacon prepares to fulfil his noble office, that of announcing the Good Tidings of Salvation. He prays God to cleanse his heart and lips. Then kneeling, lie asks the Priest's blessing ; and having received it, he at once goes to the place where he is to sing the Gospel.

72 ADVENT.

As a preparation for hearing it worthily, you may thus pray, together with the Priest and Deacon :

Munda cor meum, ac labia Alas ! these ears of mine

mea, omnipotens Deus, qui are but too of ten denied with

labia Isaiae Prophetse calculo the world's vain words ;

mundasti ignito : ita me tua cleanse them, 0 Lord, that

grata miseratione dignare so I may hear the words of

et competenter annuntiem fully explain thy law ; that

Evangelium suum : In no- so all, both pastors and flock,

mine Patris, et Filii, et Spi- may be united to thee for

ritus Sancti. Amen. ever. Amen,

You will stand during the Gospel, as though you were waiting the orders of your Lord ; and at the commencement, make the sign of the Cross on your forehead, lips, and breast; and then listen to every word of the Priest or Deacon. Let your heart be ready and obedient. Whilst my beloved was speak- ing, says the Spouse in the Canticle, my soul melted within me.1 If you have not such love as this, have at least the humble submission of Samuel, and say : SpeaJc, Lord ! thy servant heareth.2

After the Gospel, if the Priest says the Symbol of Faith, the Credo, you will say it with him. Faith is that gift of God, without which we cannot please him. It is by it that we are now looking for the coming of our Redeemer, whom as yet we do not see ; and it is faith which will merit for us the grace of his ineffable visit. Faith is the mark of those true Israelites, who are looking for the Messias, and will find him. Let us then say with the Catholic Church, our Mother :

THE NICENE CREED.

I believe in one God, the Father Almighty, maker of heaven and earth, and of all things visible and invisible.

And in one Lord Jesus Christ, the Only Begotten Son of God. And born of the Father before all ages ; God of God, light of light ; true God of true God. Begotten, not made ; consubstantial to the Father : by whom all things were made. Who for us men and for our salvation, came down from heaven. And became Incarnate by the Holy Ghost, of the Virgin Mary ; and was made man. He was crucified also for us, under Pontius Pilate, suf- fered, and was buried. And the third day he rose again according to the Scriptures. And ascended into heaven, sitteth at the right hand of the Father. And he is to come again with glory, to judge the living and the dead ; of whose kingdom there shall be no end.

And in the Holy Ghost, the Lord and giver of life, who proceedeth from the Father and the Son. Who together with the Father and the Son, is adored and glori- fied ; who spoke by the Pro- phets. And one holy Catho- lic and Apostolic Church. I confess one Baptism for the remission of sins. And I expect the resurrection of the dead, and the life of the world to come. Amen.

Et in unum Dominum Jesum Christum, Filium Dei unigenitum. Et ex Patre natum ante omnia ssecula, Deum de Deo, lumen de lumine, Deum verum de Deo vero. Genitum non factum, consubstantialem Patri : per quern omnia facta sunt. Qui propter nos homines, et prop- ter nostram salutem, descen- dit de coelis.

74 ADVENT.

The Priest and the people should, by this time, have their hearts ready : it is time to prepare the offering itself. And here we come to the second part of the Holy Mass, which is called the Oblation, and which immediately follows that which was called the Mass of Catechumens, on account of its being for- merly the only part at which the candidates for Bap- tism had a right to be present.

See, then, dear Christians ! bread and wine are about to be offered to God, as being the noblest of inanimate creatures, since they are made for the nourishment of man ; and even that is only a poor material image of what they are destined to become in our Christian sacrifice. Their substance will soon give place to God himself, and of themselves nothing will remain but the appearances. Happy creatures, thus to yield up their own being, that God may take its place ! We, too, are to undergo a like transforma- tion, when, as the Apostle expresses it, that which in us is mortal shall put on immortality} Until that happy change shall be realised, let us offer ourselves to God as often as we see the bread and wine pre- sented to him in the Holy Sacrifice ; and let us prepare ourselves for the coming of Jesus, who will transform us, by making us partakers of the divine nature?

The Priest again turns to the people with the usual salutation, as though he would warn them to redouble their attention. Let us read the Offertory with him, and when he offers the Host to God, let us unite with him in saying :

Suscipe, sancte Pater, om- All that we have, 0 Lord,

nipotens seterne Deus, hanc comes from thee, and belongs

immaculatam hostiam, quam to thee ; it is just, therefore,

ego indignus famulus tuus that we return it unto thee,

immense love ! This bread which we are offering to thee, is to give place, in a few moments, to the sacred Body of Jesus. We beseech thee, receive, together with this oblation, our hearts, which long to live by thee, and to cease to live their own life of self.

When the Priest puts the wine into the chalice, and then mingles with it a drop of water, let your thoughts turn to the divine mystery of the Incarna- tion, which in a few days is to be manifested to the world ; and say :

O Lord Jesus, who art the true Vine, and whose Blood, like a generous wine, has been poured forth under the pressure of the Cross ! thou hast deigned to unite thy divine nature to our weak humanity, which is signified by this drop of water. Oh ! come, and make us partakers of thy divinity, by showing thyself to us in thy sweet and wondrous visit.

_ Deus qui humanae substan- tias dignitatem mirabiliter conclidisti, et mirabilius re- formasti : da nobis per hujus aquae et vini mysterium, ejus divinitatis esse consortes, qui humanitatis nostrae fieri dig- natus est particeps, Jesus ChristusFilius tuus Dominus noster : qui tecum vivit et regnat in unitate Spiritus Sancti Deus, per omnia sae- cula saeculorum. Amen.

The Priest then offers the mixture of wine and water, beseeching God graciously to accept this obla- tion, the figure of which is so soon to be changed into the reality, of which it is now hut the figure. Meanwhile, say, in union with the Priest :

Graciously accept these Offerimus tibi, Domine, gifts, O sovereign Creator of calicem salutaris, tuam de-

all things. Let them be fitted for the divine transforma- tion, which will make them, from being mere offerings of created things, the instru- ment of the world's salva- tion.

precantes clementiam : ut in conspectu divinae Majestatis tuae, pro nostra et totius mundi salute, cum odore sua- vitatis ascendat. Amen.

76 ADVENT.

After having thus held up the sacred gifts towards heaven, the Priest bows down: let us, also, humble ourselves, and say :

In spiritu humilitatis, et Though daring, as we do,

in animo contrito suscipia- to approach thy altar, 0 Lord,

niur a te, Doinine : et sic fiat we cannot forget that we are

sacrificium nostrum in con- sinners. Have mercy on ns,

spectu tuo hodie, ut placeat and delay not to send us thy

tibi, Domine Deus. Son, who is our saving Host.

Let us next invoke the Holy Ghost, whose opera- tion is about to produce on the altar the presence of the Son of God, as it did in the womb of the Blessed Virgin Mary, in the divine mystery of the Incarnation :

Veni, Sanctificator omni- Come, O Divine Spirit, potens seterne Deus, et bene- make fruitful the offering die hoc sacrificium tuo sancto which is upon the altar, and nomini praeparatum. produce in our hearts Him

whom they desire.

If it be a High Mass, the Priest, before proceeding any further with the Sacrifice, takes the thurible a second time. He first incenses the bread and wine which have been just offered, and then the altar itself; hereby inviting the faithful to make their prayer, which is signified by the incense, more and more fervent, the nearer the solemn moment ap- proaches. St. John tells us that the incense, which burns on the Altar in heaven, is made of the Prayers of the Saints ; thus, during the time of Advent, the incense, which envelopes our altar on earth with its fragrant cloud, may be taken as a symbol of the longings of the Patriarchs and Prophets after the Messias. Let us imitate them by our ardent desires for this same Jesus.

But the thought of his own unworthiness becomes more intense than ever in the heart of the Priest. The public confession, which he made at the foot of the altar, is not enough ; he would now, at the altar itself, express to the people, in the language of a

THE OKDINARY OF THE MASS.

77

solemn rite, how far he knows himself to be from that spotless sanctity wherewith he should approach to God. He washes his hands. Oar hands signify our works ; and the Priest, though by his priesthood he bear the office of Jesus Christ, is, by his works, but man. Seeing your Father thus humble himself, do you also make an act of humility, and say with him these verses of

PSALM 25.

I, too, would wash my hands, O Lord, and become like unto those who are in- nocent, that so I may be worthy to come near thy altar, and hear thy sacred Canticles, and then go and proclaim to the world the wonders of thy goodness. I love the beauty of thy House, which thou art about to make the dwelling-place of thy glory. Leave me not, O God, in the midst of them that are enemies both to thee and me. Thy mercy having separated me from them, I entered on the path of inno- cence, and was restored to thy grace ; but have pity on my weakness still ; redeem me yet more, thou who hast so mercifully brought me back to the right path. In the midst of these thy faith- ful people, T give thee thanks. Glory be to the Father and to the Son, and to the Holy Ghost ; as it was in the be- ginning, is now, and ever shall be, world without end. Amen.

The Priest, taking encouragement from the act of humility he has just made, returns to the middle of

Lavabo inter innocentes manus meas : et circumdabo altare tuum, Domine.

Ut audiam vocem laudis : et enarrem universa niira- bilia tua.

the prayers they address to

thee for us.

The Priest again turns to the people ; it is for the last time before the sacred Mysteries are accomplished. He feels anxious to excite the fervour of the people. Neither does the thought of his own unworthiness leave him ; and before entering the cloud with the Lord, he seeks support in the prayers of his brethren who are present. He says to them :

Orate, fratres : ut meum Brethren, pray that my Sa-

ac vestrum sacrificium ac- crifice, which is yours also,

ceptabile fiat apud Deum may be acceptable to God,

Patrem omnipotentem. our Almighty Father.

With this request he turns again to the altar, and you will see his face no more, until our Lord himself shall have come down from heaven upon that same altar. Assure the Priest that he has your prayers, and say to him :

THE ORDINARY OF THE MASS. 79

May our Lord accept this Suscipiat Dominus sacri-

praise and glory of his name, laudem et gloriam nominis

and for our benefit and that sui, ad utilitatem quoque

out the world. suse sanctse.

Here the Priest recites the prayers called the Se- crets, in which he presents the petition of the whole Church for God's acceptance of the Sacrifice, and then immediately begins to fulfil that great duty of reli- gion, Thanksgiving. So far he has adored God, and has sued for mercy ; he has still to give thanks for the blessings bestowed on us by the bounty of our heavenly Father, and expressly for that chiefest of all his gifts, — the Messias. We are in the season of expectation of a new visit of this Son of God ; the Priest, in the name of the Church, is about to give expression to the gratitude of all mankind. In order to excite the faithful to that intensity of gratitude which is due to God for all his gifts, he interrupts his own and their silent prayer by terminating it aloud, saying :

For ever and ever ! Per omnia saecula saeculo-

rum !

In the same feeling, answer your A men ! Then he continues :

"ft. The Lord be with you. $". Dominus vobiscum. I£. And with thy spirit. 3$. Et cum spiritu tuo.

"ft. Lift up your hearts ! $". Sursum corda !

Let your response be sincere :

1$. We have them fixed on I£. Habemus ad Dominum. God.

And when he adds :

$"! Let us give thanks to $". Gratias agamus Domino the Lord our God. Deo nostro.

Answer him with all the earnestness of your soul ; 1$. It is meet and just. 1$. Dignum et justum est.

Then the Priest:

THE PREFACE (For the Sundays.)

Vere dignum et justum est, aequum et salutare, nos tibi semper, et ubique gra- tias agere, Domine sancte, Pater omnipotens, aeterne Deus. Qui cum unigenito Filio tuo et Spiritu Sancto unus es Deus, unus es Do- minus : non in unius singu- laritate Personae, sed in unius Trinitate substantias. Quod enim de tua gloria, revelante te, credimus, hoc de Filio tuo, hoc de Spiritu Sancto, sine differentia dis- cretionis sentimus. Ut in confessione verae, sempiter- naeque Deitatis, et in Per- sonis proprietas, et in essen- tia unitas, et in maj estate adoretur aequalitas. Quam laudant Angeli atque Arch- angeli, Cherubim quoque ac Seraphim ; qui non cessant clamare quotidie, una voce dicentes, Sanctus, &c.

It is truly meet and just, right and available to salva- tion, that we should always and in all places give thanks to thee, 0 Holy Lord, Father Almighty, Eternal God. Who together with thy only begot- ten Son and the Holy Ghost art one God and one Lord : not in a singularity of one Person, but in a Trinity of one substance. For what we be- lieve of thy glory, as thou hast revealed, the same we believe of thy Son and of the Holy Ghost, without any difference or distinction. So that in the confession of the true and eternal Deity, we adore a dis- tinction in the Persons, an unity in the essence, and an equality in the Majesty. Whom the Angels and Arch- angels, the Cherubim also and Seraphim praise, and cease not daily to cry out with one voice, saying, Holy, &c~

After these words commences the Canon, that mysterious prayer in the midst of which heaven bows down to earth, and God descends unto us. The voice of the Priest is no longer heard ; yea, even' at the altar, all is silence. It was thus, says the Book of Wisdom, in the quiet of silence, and while the night was in the midst of her course, that the Almighty Word came down from his royal throne.1 Let us await him in a like silence, and respectfully fix our eyes on what the Priest does in the holy place.

THE CANON OF THE MASS.

In this mysterious colloquy with the great God of heaven and earth, the first prayer of the sacrificing Priest is for the Catholic Church, his and our Mother.

1 Wisd. xviii. 14, 15.

82

ADVENT.

O God, who manifestest thyself unto us by means of the mysteries, which thou hast intrusted to thy holy Church, our Mother ; we be- seech thee, by the merits of this sacrifice, that thou wouldst remove all those hindrances which oppose her during her pilgrimage in this world. Give her peace and unity. Do thou thyself guide our Holy Father the Pope, thy Vicar on earth. Direct thou our Bishop, who is our sacred link of unity; and watch over all the orthodox children of the Catholic Apos- tolic Eoman Church.

Here pray, together with the Priest, for those whose interests should be dearest to you.

Te igitur, clementissime Pater, per Jesum Christum Filium tuum Dominum nos- trum supplices rogamus ac petimus, uti accepta habeas, et benedicas hsec dona, hsec munera, haec sancta sacrificia illibata, in primis quae tibi offerimus pro Ecclesia tua sancta Catholica : quam paci- ficare, custodire, adunare, et regere digneris toto orbe ter- rarum, una cum famulo tuo Papa nostro N., et Antistite nostro N., et omnibus ortho- doxis, atque catholicae et apostolicse fidei cultoribus.

Memento, Domine, famu- lorum famularumque tuarum N. et 1ST., et omnium circum- stantium, quorum tibi fides cognita est, et nota devotio : pro quibus tibi offerimus, vel qui tibi offerunt hoc sacrifi- cium laudis, pro se, suisque omnibus, pro redemptione animarum suarum, pro spe salutis et incolumitatis suae ; tibique reddunt vota sua asterno Deo, vivo et vero.

Permit me, 0 God, to in- tercede with thee in more earnest prayer for those, for whom thou knowest that I have a special obligation to pray : * * * Pour down thy blessings upon them. Let them partake of the fruits of this divine Sacrifice, which is offered unto thee in the name of all mankind. Visit them by thy grace, pardon them their sins, grant them the blessings of this present life and of that which is eternal.

Here let us commemorate the Saints : they are that portion of the Body of Jesus Christ, which is called the Church Triumphant.

Communicantes, et memo- riam venerantes, in primis gloriosaa semper Virginis Marise, Genitricis Dei et Domini nostri Jesu Christi :

But the offering of this Sacrifice, O my God, does not unite us with those only of our brethren who are still in this transient life of trial : it

brings us closer to those also, who are already in possession of heaven. Therefore it is, that we wish to honour by it the memory of the glorious and ever Virgin Mary; of the Apostles, Confessors, Virgins, and of all the Saints • that so they may assist us, by their powerful intercession, to be- come worthy to contemplate thee, as they now do, in the mansion of thy glory.

sed et beatorum Apostolo- rum ac Martyrum tuorum, Petri et Pauli, Andreas, Ja- cobi, Joannis, Thorn ae, Ja- cobi, Philippi, Bartholomaei, Matthaei, Simon is, et Thad- daei : Lini, Cleti, Clementis, Xysti, Cornelii, Cypriani, Laurentii, Chrysogoni, Jo- annis et Pauli, Cosmae et Damiani, et omnium Sanc- torum tuorum, quorum men- tis precibusque concedas, ut in omnibus protectionis tuae muniamur auxilio. Per eum- dem Christum Dominum nos- trum. Amen.

The Priest, who, up to this time, had been praying with his hands extended, now joins them, and holds them over the bread and wine, as the High Priest of the Old Law did over the figurative victim : he thus expresses his intention of bringing these gifts more closely under the notice of the Divine Majesty, and of marking them as the material offering whereby we profess our dependence, and which, in a few instants, is to yield its place to the living Host, upon whom all our iniquities are to be laid.

Vouchsafe, O God, to ac- cept this offering which this thy assembled family presents to thee as the homage of its most happy servitude. In return, give us peace, save us from thy wrath, and number us amongst thy elect, through Him who is coming to us, thy Son our Saviour.

Yea, Lord, this is the mo- ment when this bread is to become his sacred Body, which is our food ; and this wine is to be changed into his Blood,

Hanc igitur oblationem servitutis nostrae, sed et cunctae familiae tuae, quae- sumus Domine, ut placatus accipias : diesque nostros in tua pace disponas, atque ab aeterna damnatione nos eripi, et in electorum tuorum ju- beas grege numerari. Per Christum Dominum nostrum. Amen.

And here the Priest ceases to act as man ; he now becomes more than a mere minister of the Church. His word becomes that of Jesus Christ, with all its power and efficacy. Prostrate yourself in profound adoration ; for the Emmanuel, the God with us, is coming down from heaven.

The Divine Lamb is now upon our altar. Glory and love be to him for ever ! But he has come that he may be immolated ; for which reason the Priest, who is the minister of the will of the Most High, immediately pronounces over the chalice those sacred words which will produce the great mystical immola- tion, by the separation of the Victim's Body and Blood. The substances of the bread and wine have .jased to exist : the species alone are left, veiling, as it were, the Body and Blood, lest fear should keep us from a mystery, which God gives us in order to give us confidence. Let us associate ourselves to the Angels, who tremblingly look upon this deepest wonder.

The Priest is now face to face with God. He again raises his hands towards heaven, and tells our heavenly Father, that the oblation, now on the altar, is no longer an earthly offering, but the Body and Blood, the whole Person, of his divine Son.

Father of infinite holiness, the Host so long expected is here before thee ! Behold this thy eternal Son, who suffered a bitter passion, rose again with glory from the grave, and ascended trium- phantly into heaven. He is thy Son ; but he is also our Host, — Host pure and spot less, — our Meat and Drink of everlasting life.

Heretofore thou didst ac- cept the sacrifice of the inno- cent lambs offered to thee by Abel ; and the sacrifice which Abraham made thee of his son Isaac, who, though immolated, yet lived ; and, lastly, the sacrifice, which Melchisedech presented thee, of bread and wine. Eeceive our Sacrifice, which is above all those others. It is the Lamb of whom all others could be but figures : it is the undying Victim : it is

Unde et memores, Bo- mine, nos servi tui, sed et plebs tua sancta, ejusdem Christi Filii tui Domini nos- tri tarn beatae Passionis, nec- non et ab inferis Resurrec- tionis, sed et in ccelos glo- riosae Ascensionis : offerimus praeclarae majestati tuae de tuis donis ac datis Hostiam puram, Hostiam sanctam, Hostiam immaculatam : Pa- nem sanctum vitae aeternae, et ■ Calicem saliitis perpetuae.

ADVENT.

the Body of thy Son, who is the Bread of Life, and his Blood, which, whilst a Drink of immortality for us, is a tribute adequate to thy glory.

The Priest bows down to the altar, and kisses it as the throne of love on which is seated the Saviour of men.

Supplices te rogamus, om- nipotens Deus : jube hsec perferri per manus sancti Angeli tui in sublime Altare tuum, in conspectu divinas Majestatis tuae : ut quotquot ex hac altaris participatione, sacrosanctumFiliitui Corpus et Sanguinem sumpserimus, omni benedictione coelesti et gratia repleamur. Per eumdem Christum Dominum nostrum. Amen.

But, O God of infinite power, these sacred gifts are not only on this altar here below ; they are also on that sublime Altar of heaven, which is before the throne of thy divine Majesty. These two altars are but one and the same, on which is accom- plished the great mystery of thy glory and our salvation. Vouchsafe to make us par- takers of the Body and Blood of the august Victim, from whom flow every grace and blessing.

Nor is the moment less favourable for making sup- plication for the Church Suffering. Let us therefore ask the divine Liberator, who has come down among us, that he mercifully visit, by a ray of his consoling light, the dark abode of Purgatory, and permit his Blood to flow, as a stream of mercy's dew, from this our altar, and refresh the panting captives there. Let us pray exjDressly for those among them, who have a claim on our suffrages.

Memento etiam, Domine, famulorum famularumque tuarum N". et N., qui nos praecesserunt cum signo fidei, et dormiunt in somno pacis. Ipsis Domine, et omnibus in Christo quiescentibus, locum refrigerii, lucis et pacis, ut

in their flames, light in their

darkness, and peace in their

agonies of torment.

This duty of charity fulfilled, let us pray for our- selves, sinners, alas ! and who profit so little by the visit which our Saviour pays us. Let us, together with the Priest, strike our breast, saying :

Alas ! we are poor sinners, O God of all sanctity ! yet do we hope that thy infinite mercy will grant us to share in thy kingdom, not, indeed, by reason of our works, which deserve little more than pu- nishment, but because of the merits of this Sacrifice, which we are offering to thee. Re- member, too, the merits of thy holy Apostles, of thy holy Martyrs, of thy holy Virgins, and of all thy Saints. Grant us, by their intercession, grace in this world, and glory eter- nal in the next: which we ask of thee, in the name of our Lord Jesus Christ, thy Son. It is by him thou bestowest upon us thy blessings of life and sanctification ; and by him also, with him, and in him, in the unity of the Holy Ghost, may honour and glory be to thee !

Nobis quoque peccatoribus famulis tuis, de multitudine miserationum tuarum speran- tibus, partem aliquam et societatem donare digneris cum tuis Sanctis Apostolis et Martyribus : cum Joanne, Stephano, Matthia, Barnaba, Ignatio, Alexandra, Marcel- lino, Petro, Felicitate, Perpe- tua, Agatha, Lucia, Agnete, Csecilia, Anastasia, et omni- bus Sanctis tuis ; intra quorum nos consortium, non sestimator meriti, sed venise, qusesumus, largitor admitte.

Whilst saying these last few words, the Priest has taken up the sacred Host, which was on the altar; he has held it over the chalice, thus reuniting the Body and Blood of the divine Victim, in order to show that He is now immortal. Then raising up

88 ADVENT.

both Chalice and Host, he offers to God the most noble and perfect homage which the divine Majesty could receive.

This solemn and mysterious rite ends the Canon. The silence of the Mysteries is broken. The Priest concludes his long prayers, by saying aloud, and so giving the faithful the opportunity of expressing their desire that his supplications be granted :

Per omnia saecula saeculo- For ever and ever. rum.

Answer him with faith, and in a sentiment of union with your holy Mother the Church :

Amen. Amen ! I believe the mys-

tery which has just been ac- complished. I unite myself to the offering which has been made, and to the petitions of the Church.

It is time to recite the prayer, which our Saviour himself has taught us. Let it ascend up to heaven together with the sacrifice of the Body and Blood of Jesus Christ. How could it be otherwise than heard, when he himself who made it for us, is in our very hands now whilst we say it ? As this prayer belongs in common to all God's children, the Priest recites it aloud, and begins by inviting us all to join in it.

OREMUS. LET US PRAY.

forgive us our trespasses, as we forgive them that trespass against us ; and lead us not into temptation.

cia nobis hodie : Et dimitte nobis debita nostra, sicut et nos dimittimus debitoribus nostris. Et ne nos inducas in tentationem.

Let us answer, with deep feeling of our misery : But deliver us from evil. Sed libera nos a malo.

The Priest falls once more into the silence of the holy Mysteries. His first word is an affectionate Amen to your last petition — deliver us from evil — on which he forms his own next prayer : and could he pray for anything more needed ? Evil surrounds us everywhere, and the Lamb on our altar has been sent to expiate it and deliver us from it.

How many, O Lord, are the evils which beset us ! Evils past, which are the wounds left on the soul by our sins, and strengthen her wicked propensities. Evils present, that is, the sins now at this very time upon our soul ; the weakness of this poor soul ; and the tempta- tions which molest her. There are, also, future evils, that is, the chastisement which our sins deserve from the hand of thy justice. In presence of this Host of our Salvation, we beseech thee, O Lord, to deliver us from all these evils, and to accept in our favour the intercession of Mary the Mother of Jesus, of thy holy Apostles Peter and Paul and Andrew. Liberate us, break our chains, give us peace : through Jesus Christ, thy Son, who with thee liveth and reigneth God,

Libera nos, qusesumus Do- mine, ab omnibus malis, prseteritis, pnesentibus, et futuris : et intercedente bea- ta et gioriosa semper Virgine Dei Genitrice Maria, cum beatis Apostolis tuis Petro et Paulo, atque Andrea, et om- nibus Sanctis, da propitius pacem in diebus nostris : ut ope misericordise tuae adjuti, et a peccato simus semper liberi, et ab omni perturba- tionesecuri. PereumdemDo- minum nostrum Jesum Chri- tum Filium tuum, qui tecum vivit et regnat in unitate Spiritus Sancti Deus,

90 ADVENT.

The Priest is anxious to announce the Peace which he has asked and obtained; he therefore finishes his prayer aloud, saying :

Per omnia saecula saeculo- World without end. rum. 1$. Amen. 1$. Amen.

Then he says :

Pax Domini sit semper May the Peace of our Lord vobiscum. be ever with you.

To this paternal wish reply :

]$. Et cum spiritu tuo. 1$. And with thy spirit.

The Mystery is drawing to a close : God is about to be united with man, and man with God, by means of Communion. But first, an imposing and sublime rite takes place at the altar. So far the Priest has announced the Death of Jesus ; it is time to proclaim his resurrection. To this end, he reverently breaks the sacred Host, and having divided it into three parts, he puts one into the Chalice, thus reuniting the Body and Blood of the immortal Yictim. Do you adore, and say :

Hsec commixtio et conse- Glory be to thee, 0 Saviour cratio Corporis et Sanguinis of the world, who didst, in Domini nostri Jesu Christi thy Passion, permit thy pre- fiat accipientibus nobis in cious Blood to be separated vitam seternam. Amen. from thy sacred Body, after-

wards uniting them again together by the divine power.

Offer now your prayer to the ever-living Lamb, whom St. John saw on the Altar of Heaven standing, though slain : say to this your Lord and King :

Agnus Dei, qui tollis pec- Lamb of God, who takest cata mundi, miserere nobis. away the sins of the world,

have mercy on us. Agnus Dei, qui tollis pec- Lamb of God, who takest cata mundi, miserere nobis. away the sins of the world,

have mercy on us.

THE ORDINARY OF THE MASS. 91

Lamb of God, who takest Agnus Dei, qui tollis pee- away the sins of the world, cata mundi, dona nobis pa- give us Peace. cem.

Peace is the grand object of our Saviour's coming into the world : he is the Prince of Peace. The divine Sacrament of the Eucharist ought therefore to be the Mystery of Peace, and the bond of Catholic Unity, for, as the Apostle says, all we who partake of one Bread, are all one Bread and one Body.1 It is on this account that the Priest, now that he is on the point of receiving, in Communion, the Sacred Host, prays that fraternal Peace may be preserved in the Church, and more especially in this portion of it, which is assembled round the altar. Pray with him and for the same blessing :

Lord Jesus Christ, who Domine Jesu Christe, qui

saidst to thy Apostles, " my dixisti Apostolis tuis : Pacem

peace I leave with you, my relinquo vobis, pacem meam

peace I give unto you :" re- do vobis : ne respicias pec-

gard not my sins, but the cata mea, sed fidem Ecclesiae

faith of thy Church, and tuse : eamque secundum vo-

grant her that peace and luntatem tuam pacificare, et

unity which is according to coadunare digneris. Qui vi-

thy will. Who livest and vis et regnas Deus, per omnia

reignest God for ever and ssecula sseculorum. Amen, ever. Amen.

If it be a High Mass, the Priest here gives the kiss of peace to the Deacon, who gives it to the Sub-Deacon, and he to the Choir. During this ceremony, you should excite within yourself feelings of Christian charity, and pardon your enemies, if you have any. Then continue to pray with the Priest :

Lord Jesus Christ, Son of Domine Jesu Christe, Fili

the living God,who,according Dei vivi, qui ex voluntate

to the will of thy Father, Patris, cooperante Spiritu

through the co-operation of Sancto, per mortem tuam

the Holy Ghost, hast by thy mundum vivificasti : libera

death given life to the world ; me per hoc sacrosanctum

ADVENT.

deliver me by this thy most Sacred Body and Blood from all my iniquities, and from all evils ; and make me al- ways adhere to thy command- ments, and never suffer me to be separated from thee, who with the same God the Father and the Holy Ghost, livest and reignest God for ever and ever. Amen.

If you are going to Communion at this Mass, say the following Prayer; otherwise, prepare yourself to make a Spiritual Communion :

Corpus et Sanguinem tuum, ab omnibus iniquitatibus meis, et universis malis, et f ac me tuis semper inhaerere mandatis, et a te nunquam separari permittas. Qui cum eodem Deo Patre et Spiritu Sancto vivis et regnas Deus in ssecula sseculorum. Amen.

Let not the participation of thy Body, O Lord Jesus Christ, which I, though un- worthy, presume to receive, turn to my judgment and condemnation ; but through thy mercy may it be a safe- guard and remedy both to my soul and body. Who with God the Father, in the unity of the Holy Ghost, livest and reignest God for ever and

Perceptio Corporis tui, Domine Jesu Christe, quod ego indignus sumere prae- sumo, non mihi proveniat in judicium et condemna- tionem : sed pro tua pietate prosit mihi ad tutamentum mentis et corporis, et ad medelam percipiendam. Qui vivis et regnas cum Deo Patre in unitate Spiritus Sancti Deus, per omnia saecula sse- culorum. Amen.

ever. Amen.

When the Priest takes the Host into his hands, in order to his receiving it in Communion, say :

Come, my dear Jesus, Panem ccelestem accipiam, come ! , et nomen Domini invocabo.

When he strikes his breast, confessing his unwor- thiness, say thrice with him these words, and in the same disposition as the Centurion of the Gospel, who first used them :

Domine, non sum dignus, ut intres sub tectum meum : sed tantum die verbo,et sana- bitur anima mea.

Lord, I am not worthy thou shouldst enter under my roof ; say it only with one word of thine, and my soul will be healed.

Whilst the Priest receives the sacred Host, if you also are to communicate, adore profoundly your God,

THE ORDINARY OF (THE MASS. 93

who is ready to take up his abode within you, and again say to him with the spouse : Come, Lord Jesus, come !

But should you not be going to receive sacramen- tally, make a Spiritual Communion. Adore Jesus Christ who thus visits your soul by his grace, and say to him :

I give thee, O Jesus, this Corpus Domini nostri Jesu

heart of mine, that thou Christi, custodiat animam

mayest dwell in it, and do meam in vitam seternam.

with me what thou wilt. Amen.

Then the Priest takes the Chalice in thanksgiving and says :

What return shall I make Quid retribuam Domino

to the Lord for all he hath pro omnibus, quae retribuit

given to me ? I will take the mihi 1 Calicem salutaris ac-

Chalice of salvation, and will cipiam, et nomen Domini in-

call upon the name of the vocabo. Laudans invocabo

But if you are to make a Sacramental Communion, you should, at this moment of the Priest's receiving the precious Blood, again adore the God who is coming to you, and keep to your Canticle : Come, Lord Jesus, come !

If, on the contrary, you are going to communicate only spiritually, again adore your divine Master, and say to him :

I unite myself to thee, my SanguisDomini nostri Jesu

beloved Jesus ! do thou unite Christi custodiat animam

thyself to me ! and never let meam in vitam seternam.

us be separated. Amen.

It is here that you must approach to the altar, if you are going to Communion. The dispositions suitable for Holy Communion during this season of Advent are given in the next chapter, page 97.

The Communion being finished, and whilst the Priest is purifying the Chalice the first time, say :

94 ADVENT.

Quod ore sumpsimus, Do- Thou hast visited me, O

mine, pura mente capiamus : God, in these days of my pil-

et de munere temporali fiat grimage ; give me grace to

nobis remedium sempiter- treasure up the fruits of this

Whilst the Priest is purifying the Chalice the second time, say :

Corpus tuum, Domine, Be thou for ever blessed, O quod sumpsi, et Sanguis my Saviour, for having ad- quem potavi, adhaereat vis- mitted me to the sacred mys- ceribus meis : et prsesta ut tery of thy Body and Blood, in me non remaneat scelerum May my heart and senses pre- macula, quern pura et sancta serve, by thy grace, the purity refecerunt Sacramenta. Qui which thou hast imparted to vivis et regnas in ssecula sse- them ; and thus fit me for culorum. Amen. that glorious light of thy

Coming, that I may not then be confounded.

The Priest having read the Antiphon called the Communion, which is the first part of his Thanks- giving for the favour just received from God, where- by he has renewed his divine presence among us, — turns to the people with the usual salutation ; after which, he recites the Prayers, called the Postcom- munion, which are the completion of the Thanks- giving. You will join him here also, thanking God for the unspeakable gift he has just lavished on you, and asking, with most earnest entreaty, for the coming of the Messias, who will accomplish those august mysteries, of which the Holy Mass is the renewal ; and for that reason, the chief support of the Christian life.

These Prayers having been recited, the Priest again turns to the people, and, full of joy for the ini- mense favour he and they have been receiving, he says :

Dominus vobiscum. The Lord be with you.

Answer him : Et cum spiritu tuo. And with thy spirit.

THE ORDINARY OF T&E MASS. 95

Then, if it be a Mass of a Feast, the Deacon (or the Priest himself, if it be not a High Mass) says these words :

Go, the Mass is finished. Ite, Missa est.

1£. Thanks be to God. I£. Deo gratias.

But if it be a Mass proper to Advent, he does not dismiss the faithful, because, in this holy season, it behoves us to increase our prayers ; he therefore says:

"fT. Let us bless the Lord. ft. Benedicamus Domino.

1$. Thanks be to God. 1$. Deo gratias.

The Priest makes a last prayer, before giving you his blessing : pray with him :

Eternal thanks be to thee, Placeat tibi, sancta Trini-

O adorable Trinity, for the tas, obsequiuin servitutis

and deign to confirm the trum. Blessing, which thy Minister is about to give me in thy Name.

The priest raises his hand, and thus blesses you :

May the Almighty God, Benedicat vos omnipotens Father, Son, and Holy Ghost, Deus, Pater, et Filius, et bless you ! Spiritus Sanctus.

He then concludes the Mass by reading the first fourteen verses of the Gospel according to St. John, which tell us of the eternity of the Word, and of the mercy which led him to take upon himself owe flesh, and to divell among us. Pray that you may be of the number of those, who will receive him, when he comes, this year, into the midst of his people.

Initium sancti Evangelii se- cundum Joannem.

Cap. I. In principio erat Verbum, et Verbum erat apud Deum, et Deus erat Verbum. Hoc erat in principio apud Deum. Omnia per ipsum facta sunt ; et sine ipso factum est nihil. Quod factum est, in ipso vita erat, et vita erat lux homi- num: et lux in tenebris lucet, et tenebrse earn non compre- henderunt. Fuit homo mis- sus a Deo, cui nomen erat Joannes. Hie venit in testi- monium, ut testimonium perhiberet de lumine, ut omnes erederent per ilium. Non erat ille lux, sed ut testimonium perhiberet de lumine. Erat lux vera, quae illuminat omnem hominem venientem in hunc mundum. In mundo erat, et mundus per ipsum f actus est, et mun- dus eum non cognovit. In propria venit, et sui eum non receperunt. Quotquot autem receperunt eum, dedit eis potestatem filios Dei fieri, his, qui credunt in nomine ejus : qui non ex sanguinibus, neque ex voluntate carnis, neque ex voluntate viri, sed ex Deo nati sunt. Et Ver- bum caro factum est, et habi- tavit in nobis : et vidimus gloriam ejus, gloriam quasi Unigeniti a Patre, plenum gratise et veritatis.

I£. Deo gratias.

The beginning of the holy- Gospel according to John.

Ch.I. In the beginning was the Word, and the Word was with God, and the Word was God. The same was in the beginning with God. All things were made by him, and without him was made nothing that was made. In him was life, and the life was the light of men ; and the light shineth in darkness, and the darkness did not compre- hend it. There was a man sent from God, whose name was John. This man came for a witness, to give testi- mony of the light, that all men might believe through him. He was not the light, but was to give testimony of the light. That was the true light, which enlighteneth every man that cometh into this world. He was in the world, and the world was made by him, and the world knew him not. He came unto his own, and his own received him not. But as many as received him, to them he gave power to be made the sons of God ; to them that believe in his name, who are born, not of blood, nor of the will of the flesh, nor of the will of man, but of God. And the Word was made flesh, and dwelt among us ; and we saw his glory, as it were the glory of the only- begotten of the Father, full of grace and truth. 1$. Thanks be to God.

CHAPTER THE SIXTH.

ON HOLY COMMUNION DUEING ADVENT.

It is true, that everything in Advent is so ar- ranged as to be a preparation for the Coming of the Saviour at the Feast of Christmas, and that the spirit of the faithful should be one of earnest expec- tation of this same Saviour : and yet, such is the happy lot of the children of the New Law, that they can, if they wish it, really, and at once, receive this God whom the Church is expecting ; and thus this familiar visit of Jesus will become itself one of the preparations for his great and solemn visit. Let those, then, who are living the life of grace, and to whom the glorious day of the nativity of our Lord Jesus Christ will bring an increase of spiritual life, not omit to prepare, by Communion, for the recep- tion they intend to give to the heavenly Spouse on the sacred night of his Coming. These Communions will be interviews with their divine Lord, giving them confidence and love, and all those interior disposi- tions wherewith they would welcome him who comes to load them with fresh grace, — for this Jesus is full of grace and truth.

They will understand this better by reflecting on the sentiments which the august Mother of Jesus had in her blessed soul during the time which pre- ceded the divine Birth. This Birth is to be an event of more importance, both to the salvation of man- kind and to Mary's own glo^, than even that of the first accomplishment of the Incarnation ; for the Word was made Flesh in order that he might be born. The immense happiness of holding in her arms her Son and her God, would make the sacred

98 ADVENT.

hour of Jesus' Birth dearer and happier to Mary, than even that in which she was overshadowed by the Holy Ghost, and received from him the divine fruit of her womb. During those nine months, when she knew that her Jesus was so undividedly hers, what must have been the happiness which filled her heart ! It was a bliss which was a worthy prepara- tion for that more blissful night of Bethlehem.

Christians ! your Communions during Advent are to prepare you for your Christmas joy, by giving you something of the delight which Mary felt before the birth of Jesus. When you are in the House of God, preparing by recollection and prayer for receiving your Saviour in Holy Communion, you may per- haps be assisted in your preparation by the senti- ments and affections which we have ventured to offer

you in the following acts.

BEFORE COMMUNION.

ACT OF FAITH.

Knowing that thou art about to enter under my roof, O eternal God, Jesus Son of the Father, I have need of all my faith. Yes, it is thou who art coming to me, thou who didst enter into Mary's virginal womb, making it the sanctuary of thy Majesty. Thou didst send thine angel to her, and she believed bis word, when he said : Nothing is impossible to God ; the Holy Ghost shall come upon thee, and the power of the Most High shall overshadow thee. She believed, and then conceived in her chaste womb Him who had created her. Thou hast not sent an Angel to me, O my Saviour, to tell me thou art coming into my heart. Thou hast spoken thyself, and thou hast said : / am the living Bread, come down from heaven: he that eateth my flesh and drinketh my blood, abideth in me and I in him. Thou hast willed that these words of thine, spoken so many hundred years ago, should reach me by thy Church, that thus I might have both the certainty that they are thine, and the merit of bowing down my reason to the deepest of mysteries. I believe then, O Jesus ! Help the weakness of my faith. Enable me to submit, as Mary did, to thy infinite wisdom ; and since thou desirest to enter under my roof, I bow down

BEFORE COMMUNION. 99

my whole being before thee, using her blessed words : May it be done to me according to thy word ; for how dare I, who am but nothingness, resist thee, who art all wisdom and power !

ACT OF HUMILITY.

But, O my Saviour, when thou didst choose the womb of the glorious Virgin for thy abode, thou hadst but to leave one heaven for another. Thou hadst prepared her, from her Conception, with every grace ; and she, on her part, had been more faithful to thee than all Angels and men together. Whereas, my heart has nothing in it, which can induce thee to come and make it thy dwelling. How many times has it not refused thee admittance, when thou didst stand at the door asking me to receive thee 1 And even had I been always faithful, what proportion is there between its low- liness and thy infinite greatness ? Elizabeth humbled her- self when she was visited by Mary, and exclaimed, How comes such cm honour to me ? And I am to receive a visit, not merely of the Mother of God, but of God himself, and in such an intimate, familiar manner, that a greater union cannot be. Thou sayest, He that eateth me, abideth in me and I in him : 0 Son of God ! thou seekest, then, for what is lowest and poorest, and in that thy heart loves to dwell. I am overwhelmed with admiration at this condescension ; but when I reflect that thou art going to show it to me, I can do nothing but sink into my own nothingness and there beseech thee to show me more and more clearly that I am but nothing ; that so, when thou art come within me, my whole being may proclaim the glory, the mercy, the power of my Jesus.

ACT OF CONTRITION.

Happy me, O Jesus, if I could feel that this my nothing- ness was the only obstacle to the glorious union to which thou invitest me ! I would then approach to thee, after the example of thy Immaculate Mother, my august Queen, and would dare to partake of the banquet at which she is on thy right hand. But I am worse than nothing, — I am a sinner : and surely there can be no union between Infinite Sanctity and sin, between Light and darkness ! I have been thine enemy, O my Redeemer ! and yet thou wishest to come into my heart, with the sores of its shame and wounds barely closed ; and thou tellest me, that thou, who couldst delight to dwell in Mary's heart, canst find pleasure in mine ! Oh ! how this teaches me the malice of my sins, since they offended a God so generous, so wonderful in his love forme ! In these few moments, which precede thy descending into

100 ADVENT.

the midst of my darkness in order to change it into light, what can I do but renew my sorrow for those many sins whereby I lost thee, as also for those whereby I grieved thee without losing thy grace *? Accept this my contrition, O my Saviour ! It is thus that I would prepare thy way to my heart, by removing everything which is in opposition to the righteous path of thy holy Law.

ACT OF LOVE.

For, I would indeed love thee, O my Saviour, as Mary loved thee. Art thou not my God, as thou wast hers 1 Nay, by forgiving me my sins, hast thou not showed marks of tenderness to me, which Mary could not receive 1 I love thee then, sweet Jesus, who art coming into me. Most wel- come visit, which is to increase my love ! Thy blessed Mother had lived, up to the very moment when thou didst enter her womb, in all holiness and justice ; she had loved thee alone, and as no other had loved : but when she felt thee within her, when she felt that now thou wast one and the same with herself, her love redoubled, and lost all sight of limit. May it be so with my heart, when thou comest into it, my God and my all ! Yea, come quickly ; for though most un- worthy of thy visit, yet am I forced to desire it, seeing that thou art the Bread which giveth life unto the ivorld, and our daily Bread, by eating which, we support life until the day of our eternity arrives. Come, then, my Lord Jesus I my heart is ready, and trusts in thee.

And thou, O Mary, by the joy thou didst experience in containing within thyself Him, whom heaven and earth could not contain, help me, in this Communion, to have my heart pure and fervent. — Holy Angels, who looked with astonishment and awe upon this simple creature carrying God within her, have pity on me, that poor sinner, whose heart, so lately the abode of Satan, is this very hour to become the tabernacle of your same Sovereign Lord. — All ye Saints of heaven, and ye especially my ever faithful Patrons, come to my assistance now that there is coming down to me, a sinful mortal, He in whom ye live for ever, just and immortal. Amen.

Id order to make your Preparation complete, follow, with a lively faith and attention, all the mysteries of the Mass at which you are to receive Communion ; using, for this purpose, the method we have given in the preceding Chapter. After your Communion, you may sometimes make your Thanks- giving by reciting the prayers we here give.

AFTER COMMUNION. 101

AFTER COMMUNION.

ACT OF ADOKATION.

O Sovereign Majesty of God ! thou hast, then, mercifully deigned to come down to me ! This favour, which thou didst heretofore grant to Mary, has been given to me too ! Would that I, during these happy moments, could adore thee as profoundly as she did ! The sentiment of her lowliness and un worthiness, at that solemn moment, would have over- powered her, had not thy tender love for her supported her to bear that ineffable union of the Creator with his creature. My lowliness, and, still more, my unworthiness, are of a very different kind from hers ; and yet I find it so hard to feel them. This much at least I know, that in order thus to come to me, and be my own infinite treasure, thou hast had to overcome immense obstacles. What, then, shall I do for thee, that is worthy of thee % How can I best compensate thee for the humiliation thou hast thus borne out of love for me? I can but adore thee, and humble myself to the furthest depths of my own nothingness. And because this my adora- tion is not worthy of thine acceptance, I presume to offer thee that which Mary herself offered thee the first moment she became Mother of God, and during the nine months thou wast so closely united with her. Thou hast given me her to be my own Mother ; permit me to make this use of her wealth, which she loves to see her children so freely giving to thy greater glory.

ACT OF THANKSGIVING.

But thy Blessed Mother, 0 Jesus, was not satisfied with adoring thee interiorly ; her glad heart soon gave expression to its intense gratitude. She saw that thou hadst preferred her to all the daughters of her people, nay, to all generations both past and to come ; her soul therefore thrilled with de- light, and her lips could scarce give utterance to her im- mense joy. He that is mighty, she said, hath done great things in me ; he hath regarded the lowliness of his hand- maid ; and all generations shall call me Blessed. And hast thou not favoured me, O Jesus, above thousands and tens of thousands, in giving me the wonderful gift I now hold with- in me 1 Thou hast made me live after the accomplishment

102 ADVENT.

of thine Incarnation. This very day, how many pious servants of thine have not had given to them what I have received from thee \ I possess thee here within me ; I know the worth of thy Coming ; but how many are there who neither possess thee, nor know thee 1 Thou hast indeed invited all to these graces, but a great number have refused them ; and while thou hast compelled me, by the powerful yet sweet ways of thy mercy, to come to thee, thou hast, in thy justice, permitted them to continue in their refusal. Mayest thou be for ever blessed, 0 my God ! who lovest, indeed, all the works of thy hands, and wishest all men to be saved ; so that none are lost, but them that refuse thy grace ; — yet, in the superabundant riches of thy mercy, thou dost multiply, for many, the boundless resources of thy love.

ACT OF LOVE.

I will love thee, then, 0 Jesus ! because thou hast first loved me ; and I will love thee the more because, by this thy visit to me, thou hast so greatly increased my power to love. It was thus with Mary, when thou didst choose her for thy Mother. Up to that time she had been the most faithful of thy creatures, and deserved the preference thou didst give her, above all women, of being honoured with the high privilege of becoming Mother of God. But when thou didst enter her virginal womb, when thy divine Person came into that admirable contact with her nature, which, though holy, was human ; Mary, transformed, as it were, into thee, began to love thee as she had never been able to do before. May it be so with me, dear Jesus ! May my own life be lost in thine ! Is not the visit thou hast paid me that of a God ! The visits of creatures are but exterior ; thine to me is in- terior ; thou hast not entered my house and blessed it, thou hast penetrated into the deepest recesses of my very soul ; so that / live, no, it is not 1, but thou livest in me, as thy Apostle expresses the mystery. So that if I love myself, I must love thee, since thou abidest in me and I abide in thee. Can I ever separate from thee again % No, my Divine Master, I' desire to have but thee for my love and my very life, now and for ever.

ACT OF OBLATION.

But, take heed, my soul — let not thy love of thy God be mere sentiment. He that loves God, lives for him. Jesus' presence produced in Mary, the moment it was effected, far more than the sentiment of total devotedness of herself to the interests and glory of him who was both her God and her

AFTER COMMUNION. 103

Son. It gave her a conformity to all God's appointments, which stood unshaken, without one moment of faltering, through all the trials of her long life. Thou hast visited me, dear Saviour, and courage is what thou wishest to leave with me. Between this day and that of my death and my judg- ment, I am to go through many trials and temptations, all difficult, and some of them perhaps severe. If I love thee, I shall triumph over them all. And how can I but love thee, even at the bar 3 remembrance of this thy visit to me, which thou art ready to repeat as often as I wish it ! I am thine, O God of my heart, as thou art mine. Thou knowest my great weakness : give me courage and strength. Thou hast given me, this happy hour, the richest pledge of thy mercy; on this infinite mercy I rest all my hope.

O Mary, pray for me that I may profit by this visit of thy Divine Son. — Ye holy Angels of God, defend me against my enemies, for your Lord has made me his dwelling-place. — All ye Saints of God, pray for me, that I may never lose this Sovereign Good, with whom ye are united for a happy eternity. Amen.

CHAPTER THE SEVENTH.

ON THE OFFICE OF SUNDAY'S VESPERS; DURING ADVENT.

The limits, which necessity requires us to put to this volume, will not admit of our inserting any of the day Office beyond the Vespers and Compline, andr moreover, the faithful rarely assist at any other of the Canonical Hours, during this part of the Litur- gical Year. We add to each of them a brief expla- nation.

The Office of Vespers, or Even Song, consists firstly of five Psalms with their Antiphons. The Antiphons of each Sunday are given further on, in the Proper of the Time.

It commences with the supplication, which the Church makes to God at the beginning of all her Hours :

1?. Deus, in adjutorium $". Incline unto my aid, O meum intende. God.

1$. Domine, ad adjuvan- I£. 0 Lord, make haste to dum me festina. help me.

Gloria Patri, et Filio, et Glory be to the Father, and Spiritui Sancto : to the Son, and to the Holy

Ghost:

Sicut erat in principio et As it was in the beginning, nunc et semper, et in ssecula is now, and ever shall be, sseculorum. Amen. Alleluia, world without end. Amen.

Alleluia.

The first Psalm is a prophecy of the glory of the Messias. Let us, during this season, the more ear- nestly proclaim the greatness of the Incarnate Word,

SUNDAY S VESPERS.

105

the more we see him humbled, out of love for us, during these days which precede his divine Birth.

PSALM 109.

The Lord said to my Lord, his son : Sit thou at my right hand, and reign with me.

Until, on the day of thy last coming, I make thy ene- mies thy footstool.

0 Christ ! the Lord thy Father will send forth the sceptre of thy power out of Sion : from thence rule thou in the midst of thy enemies.

With thee is the principality in the day of thy strength, in the brightness of the saints : for the Father hath said to thee : From the womb before the day-star I begot thee.

The Lord hath sworn, and he will not repent : he hath said,speaking of thee, the God- Man : Thou art a Priest for ever, according to the order of Melchisedech.

Therefore, 0 Father, the Lord thy Son is at thy right hand : he hath broken kings in the day of his wrath.

He shall also judge among nations ; in that terrible coming, he shall fill the ruins of the ivorld ; he shall crush the heads in the land of many.

He cometh now in humility; he shall drink, in the way, of the torrent of sufferings: therefore shall he lift up the head.

Dixit Domiims Domino meo :* Sede a dextris meis.

Donee ponam inimicos tuos : * scabellum pedum tuorum.

Virgam virtutis tuse emit- tet Dominus ex Sion :* do- minare in medio inimicorum tuorum.

Tecum principium in die virtutis tuse in splendoribus sanctorum : * ex utero ante luciferum genui te.

Juravit Dominus, et non pcenitebit eum : * Tu es Sa: cerdos in aeternum secundum ordinem Melchisedech.

The following Psalm commemorates the mercies of God to his people, the promised Covenant, the Redemption, his fidelity to his promises.

PSALM 110.

Confitebor tibi, Domine, in toto corde meo : * in con- cilio justorum et congrega- tione.

Magna opera Domini : * exquisita in onines volunta- tes ejus.

Confessio et magnificentia opus ejus:* et justitia ejus manet in sseculuin sseculi.

Memoriam fecit mirabi- lium suorum, misericors et miserator Dominus : * escam dedit timentibus se.

Memor erit in sseculum testamenti sui : * virtutem operum suorum annuntiabit populo suo.

Ut det illis haereditatem Gentium : * opera manuum ejus Veritas et judicium.

Fidelia omnia mandata ejus, confirmata in sseculuni saeculi : * facta in veritate et aequitate.

Redemptionem misit populo suo : * man davit in seternum testamentum suum.

Sanctum etterribilenomen ejus : * initium sapientiae timor Domini.

Intellectus bonus omnibus facientibus eum : * laudatio ejus manet in saeculum sae- culi.

I will praise thee, O Lord, with my whole heart : in the counsel of the just, and in the congregation.

Great are the works of the Lord : sought out according to all his wills.

His work is praise and magnificence : and his justice continueth for ever and ever.

He hath made a remem- brance of his wonderful works, being a merciful and gracious Lord : and being the Bread of life, he hath given food to them that fear him.

He will be mindful for ever of his covenant with men: he ivill come and will show forth to his people the power of his works.

That he may give them, his Church, the inheritance of the Gentiles : the works of his hand are truth and judg- ment.

All his commandments are faithful, confirmed for ever and ever : made in truth and equity.

He hath sent Redemption to his people, and this Re- deemer will soon appear : he hath, thereby, commanded his covenant for ever.

Holy and terrible is his name : the fear of the Lord is the beginning of wisdom.

A good understanding to all that do it : his praise con- tinueth for ever and ever.

The third Psalm sings the happiness of the just man, and his hopes on the day of our Lord's second

PSALM 111.

Blessed is the man that feareth the Lord : he shall delight exceedingly in his commandments.

His seed shall be mighty upon earth: the generation of the righteous shall be blessed.

Glory and wealth shall be in his house : and his justice remaineth for ever and ever.

To the righteous a light is risen up in darkness : he is merciful, and compassionate, and just.

Acceptable is the man that showeth mercy and lendeth ; he shall order his words with judgment : because he shall not be moved for ever.

The just shall be in ever- lasting remembrance : he shall not fear the evil hearing.

His heart is ready to hope in the Lord ; his heart is strengthened : he shall not be moved until he look over his enemies.

He hath distributed, he hath given to the poor ; his justice remaineth for ever and ever : his horn shall be exalted in glory.

The wicked shall see, and shall be angry : he shall gnash with his teeth, and pine away : the desire of the wicked shall perish.

The fourth Psalm is a Canticle of praise to the Lord, who, from his high heaven, has taken pity on the fallen human race, and raised it up again by the Incarnation.

Beatus vir, qui timet Do- minum : * in mandatis ejus volet nimis.

Potens in terra erit semen ejus : * generatio rectorum benedicetur.

Gloria, et divitias in domo ejus : * et justitia ejus manet in saeculuni saeculi.

Exortum est in tenebris lumen rectis : * misericors, et miserator, et Justus.

Jucundus homo, qui mise- retur et commodat, disponet sermones suos in judicio : * quia in seternum non com- movebitur.

In memoria seterna erit Justus :* ab auditione mala non timebit.

Paratum cor ejus sperare in Domino, confirmatum est cor ejus : * non commovebi- tur donee despiciat inimicos suos.

Dispersit, dedit pauperi- bus, justitia ejus manet in sseculum saeculi : * cornu ejus exaltabitur in gloria.

Praise the Lord, ye chil- dren : praise ye the name of the Lord.

Blessed be the name of the Lord : from henceforth now and for ever.

From the rising of the sun unto the going down of the same, the name of the Lord is worthy of praise.

The Lord is high above all nations : and his glory above the heavens.

Who is as the Lord our God, who dwelleth on high : and looketh down on the low things in heaven and in earth % _

Raising up the needy from the earth : and lifting up the poor out of the dunghill.

That he may place him with princes: with the princes of his people.

Who maketh a barren wo- man to dwell in a house, the

joyful mother of children. The fifth Psalm recalls the memory of the pro- digies done under the ancient Covenant ; this will naturally awaken within us the hope of seeing those things, which happened to the people of Israel in figure, realised at the coming of the Messias.

PSALM 113.

In exitu Israel de iEgypto: * domus Jacob de populo barbaro.

Facta est Judaea sanctifi- catio ejus : * Israel potestas ejus.

Judea was made his sanc- tuary : Israel his dominion.

At the presence of the Lord the earth was moved, at the presence of the God of Jacob.

Who turned the rock into pools of water, and the stony hill into fountains of waters.

Not to us, O Lord, not to us : but to thy name give glory.

For thy mercy, and for thy truth's sake : lest the Gen- tiles should say : Where is their God ?

But our God is in heaven ; he hath done all things what- soever he would.

The idols of the Gentiles are silver and gold: the works , of the hands of men.

They have mouths, and speak not : they have eyes, and see not.

They have ears, and hear not : they have noses, and smell not.

They have hands, and feel not : they have feet, and walk not : neither shall they cry out through their throat.

Let them that make them become like unto them : and all such as trust in them.

He hath blessed the house of Israel : he hath blessed the house of Aaron.

He hath blessed all that fear the Lord, both little and great.

May the Lord add blessings upon you : upon you, and upon your children.

Blessed be you of the Lord, who made heaven and earth.

The heaven of heaven is the Lord's : but the earth he has given to the children of men.

The dead shall not praise thee, O Lord : nor any of them that go down to hell.

But we that live bless the Lord : from this time now and for ever.

After these five Psalms, a short lesson from the holy Scriptures is then sung. It is called Capitidum, because it is always very short. It will be found in its proper place for each Sunday. Then follows the Hymn :

Lest the world should per- ish by the fraud of the devil, thou, impelled by the vehe- mence of thy love for us, didst thyself become the remedy of all our weakness.

To expiate the sin of the whole world, thou didst come from the sanctuary of the Virgin's womb, a victim des- tined to the cross.

How glorious is thy power, when, at the very sound of thy Name, heaven and hell bend their trembling knee !

We beseech thee, dread Judge of the last day, defend us from our enemies by the armour of thy heavenly grace.

Power, honour, praise, and glory, be to the Father, and to the Son, and to the Holy

Here is sung the Magnificat Antiphon, which is given in the Proper of each Sunday. After this the Church alwaj^s sings at Vespers, the Canticle in which our Blessed Lady, all full of the God whom she had within her womb, gave utterance, in the presence of St. Elizabeth, to the transports of her joy and gratitude. This Canticle harmonises most sweetly with the spirit of Advent, for it is during this very time that Mary is almost incessantly before our minds, as the beautiful Mother that bears her pre- cious and divine Fruit. Let us, therefore, unite with her, in celebrating the matchless honour bestowed on her by God ; the merits of that profound humility which rendered her worthy of such an honour ; the overthrow of the proud spirits who were driven from heaven ; and the exaltation of human nature, of itself so poor and miserable, to that high place from which Angels fell.

He hath put down the mighty from their seat : and hath exalted the humble.

He hath filled the hungry with good things : and the rich he hath sent empty away.

He hath received Israel his servant, being mindful of his mercy.

As he spake to our fathers, to Abraham and to his seed for ever.

CHAPTER THE EIGHTH.

ON THE OFFICE OF COMPLINE; DURING ADVENT.

This Office, which concludes the day, commences by a warning of the dangers of the night : then imme- diately follows the public Confession of our sins, as a powerful means of propitiating the divine justice, and obtaining God's help, now that we are going to spend so many hours in the unconscious and there- fore dangerous state of sleep, which is also such an image of death.

The Lector, addressing the Priest, says to him :

y. Jube, Doinine, benedi- Pray, Father, give thy bless- cere. ing.

The Priest answers :

Noctem quietam, et finem May the Almighty Lord

perfectum concedat nobis grant us a quiet night and a

1$. Amen. 1$. Amen.

The Lector then reads these words, from the first Epistle of St. Peter :

_ Fratres : Sobrii estote, et Brethren, be sober and

vigilate : quia adversarius watch : for your adversary

vester diabolus, tamquam leo the devil goes about like a

rugiens circuit quasrens quern roaring lion, seeking whom

The Choir answers :

1$. Thanks be to God. 1$. Deo gratias.

Then, the Priest :

ft. Our help is in the name ft. Adjutorium nostrum in of the Lord. nomine Domine.

The Choir :

1$. Who hath made heaven I£. Qui fecit ccelum et ter- and earth. ram.

Then the Lord's Prayer is recited in secret ; after which the Priest says the Confiteor, and, when he has finished, the Choir repeats it.

The Priest, having pronounced the general form of absolution, says :

ft. Convert us, 0 God our ft. Converte nos, Deus,

^. And turn away thine 1$. Et averte iram tuam a

Ant. Have mercy. Ant. Miserere.

The first Psalm expresses the confidence with which the just man sleeps in peace ; but the wicked know not what calm rest is. It also speaks of the eternal Word, the Light of the Father, who is coming to dispel our darkness.

PSALM 4.

When I called upon him, Cum invocarem exaudivit

Quoniam tu, Domine, sin- gulariter in spe : constitu- isti me.

O ye sons of men, how long will you be dull of heart] why do you love vanity, and seek after lying 1

Know ye also that the Lord hath made his Holy One won- derful : the Lord will hear me when I shall cry unto him.

Be ye angry, and sin not : the things you say in your hearts, be sorry for them upon your beds.

Offer up the sacrifice of justice, and trust in the Lord : many say, Who showeth us good things 1

The Light of thy counte- nance, OLord, is signed upon us : thou hast given gladness in my heart.

By the fruit of their corn, their wine, and oil, they are multiplied.

In peace, in the self same, I will sleep, and I will rest.

For thou, O Lord, singu- larly hast settled me in hope.

The Church has introduced here the six first Verses of the thirtieth Psalui, because they contain the prayer which our Saviour made when dying: Into thy hands, 0 Lord, I commend my spirit! words so beautifully appropriate in this Office of the close of day. During Advent, the Church lays par- ticular stress on those verses of this Psalm, in which David invokes him who is the Deliverer and Sa-

viour,

PSALM 30.

In te, Domine, speravi, non confundar in seternurn : * in justitia tua libera me.

In thee, 0 Lord, have I hoped, let me never be con- founded : deliver me in thy justice.

COMPLINE.

-117

Bow down thy ear to me : make haste to deliver me.

Be thou unto me a God, a protector, and a house of re- fuge, to save me.

For thou art my strength, and my refuge : and for thy name's sake thou wilt lead me, and nourish me.

Thou wilt bring me out of this snare, which they have hidden for me : for thou art my protector.

Into thy hands I commend my spirit : thou hast re- deemed me, 0 Lord, the God of truth.

Inclina ad me aurem tuam : * accelera ut eruas me.

Esto mihi in Deum pro- tectorem, et in domum re- f ugii : * ut salvum me facias.

Quoniam fortitudo mea, et refugium meum es tu : * et propter nomen tuum deduces me, et enutries me.

Educes me de laqueo hoc, quern absconderunt mihi : * quoniam tu es protector meus.

In manus tuas commendo spiritum meum : * redemisti me, Domine, Deus veritatis.

The third Psalm gives the motives of the just man's confidence, even during the dangers of the night. Then, we have God himself speaking, and promising to show us our Saviour.

PSALM 90.

He that dwelleth in the aid of the Most High, shall abide under the protection of the God of heaven.

He shall say to the Lord : Thou art my protector, and my refuge : my God, in him will I trust.

For he hath delivered me from the snare of the hun- ters : and from the sharp word.

He will overshadow thee with his shoulders : and un- der his wings thou shalt trust.

His truth shall compass thee with a shield : thou shalt not be afraid of the terror of the night.

Of the arrow that flieth in

A thousand shall fall at thy side, and ten thousand at thy right hand : but it shall not come nigh thee.

But thou shalt consider with thy eyes : and shalt see the reward of the wicked.

Because thou hast said: Thou, O Lord, art my hope : Thou hast made the Most High thy refuge.

There shall no evil come to thee, nor shall the scourge come near thy dwelling.

For he hath given his Angels charge over thee : to keep thee in all thy ways.

In their hands they shall bear thee up : lest thou dash thy foot against a stone.

Thou shalt walk upou the asp and basilisk : and thou shalt trample under foot the lion and the dragon.

God ivill say of thee : Because he hoped in me, I will deliver him : I will pro- tect him, because he hath known my name.

He will cry to me, and I will hear him : I am with him in tribulation, I will deliver him, and I will glorify him.

I will fill him with length of days : and I will show him my salvation.

The fourth Psalm invites the Servants of God to persevere with fervour, in the prayers they offer during the Night. The Faithful should say this Psalm in a spirit of gratitude to God, for his raising

Who stand in the house of the Lord, in the courts of the house of our God.

In the nights lift up your hands to the holy places, and bless ye the Lord.

Say to Israel: May the Lord out of Sion bless thee, he that made heaven and earth.

Ant. Have mercy on me, 0 Lord, and hear my prayer.

The Canticle of the venerable Simeon, — who, whilst holding the divine Infant in his arms, proclaimed him to be the Light of the Gentiles, and then slept the sleep of the just, — admirably expresses the rest which a good Christian, whose heart is united to God, enjoys in Jesus • for, as the Apostle says, whether we wake or sleep, ive live together with him who died for us.1

ADVENT

PROPER OF THE TIME.

Under this heading of Proper of the Time, we here comprise the moveable Office of the Sundays and Ferias of Advent. Though anxious to give to the faithful the flowers of the Advent Liturgy, yet were we to bring forward even those which might be considered as the choicest, four volumes would have barely sufficed. The fear of making our work too expensive to the faithful, persuaded us to limit it within much narrower bounds, and out of the abun- dant treasures before us, to give what we thought could be least dispensed with.

The plan we have adopted is this : We give the whole of the Mass and Vespers for the four Sundays of Advent. On the Ferial days, we give one, at least, of the lessons from Isaias, which are read in the Office of Matins; adding to this a Hymn or Sequence, or some other poetic liturgical composition. All these have been taken from the gravest sources, for example, from the Roman and Mozarabic Breviaries, from the Greek Anthology and Meusea, from the Missals of the Middle Ages, &c. After this Hymn or Sequence, we have given a Prayer from the Ambro- sian, Gallican, or Mozarabic Missals. So that the faithful will find, in our collection, an unprecedented abundance of liturgical formulae, each of which carries authority with it, as being taken from ancient and approved sources.

126 ADVENT.

We have not thought it desirable to give a com- mentary to each of the liturgical formulae inserted in our work. It seemed to us that they would be ren- dered sufficiently intelligible by the general explana- tion which runs through our work, and in which ex- planation we have endeavoured to excite the devotion of the reader, give unity to the several parts, and afford solid instruction. We shall thus avoid all those repetitions and common-place remarks, which do little more than fatigue the reader.

We have inserted the Great Antiphons and the Office of Christmas Eve in the Proper of the Saints, because both of these have fixed days in the Calen- dar, and to put them in the Proper of the Time, as they are in the Breviary and Missal, would have re- quired us to introduce into a book, destined for the laity, rubrics which are somewhat complicated, and would, perhaps, not have been understood.

FIRST SUNDAY OF ADVENT. 127

THE FIRST SUNDAY OF ADVENT.

This Sunday, the first of the ecclesiastical year, is called, in the chronicles and charts of the Middle Ages, Ad te levavi Sunday, from the first words of the Introit ; or, Aspiciens a longe, from the first words of one of the Responsories of Matins.

The Station1 is at St. Mary Major's. It is under the auspices of Mary, — in the splendid Basilica which possesses the Crib of Bethlehem, and is therefore called, in ancient documents, St. Mary's ad Prcesepe, — that the Roman Church recommences, each year, the sacred Cycle. It would have been impossible to select a place more suitable than this for saluting the approach of the Divine Birth, which is to gladden heaven and earth, and manifest the sublime portent of a Virgin Mother. Let us go in spirit to this august temple, and unite in the prayers which are there being offered up : they are the very ones we also use, and which we will now explain.

In the Night Office, the Church commences the reading of the Book of Isaias, who, of all the Prophets, has the most distinctly and explicitly foretold the Messias; and she continues this same Book until Christmas Day inclusively. Let us strive to enter into the teaching of the holy Prophet, and let the eye of our faith affectionately recognise the promised Saviour in the descriptions, sometimes consoling and sometimes terrifying, under which Isaias depicts him.

1 The Stations marked in the Roman Missal for certain days in the year, were formerly processions, in which the whole clergy and people went to some given church, and there celebrated the Office and Mass. This usage, which dates from the earliest period of the "Roman Church, and of which St. Gregory the Great was but the restorer, still exists, at least in a measure ; for the Stations are still observed, though with less solemnity and con- course of people, on all the days specified in the Missal.

128

ADVENT.

Regem venturum Domi num, venite adoremus.

The first words of the Church, in the still mid- night, are these :

Come, let us adore the King our Lord, who is to come.

This first duty of adoration complied with, let us listen to the oracle of the Prophet Isaias, delivered to us by the holy Church :

Incipit liber Isaiae Prophetse.

Cap. I. Visio Isaise filii Amos, quam vidit super Judam et Jerusa- lem, in diebus Oziae, Joathan, Achaz, et Ezechise regum Juda. Audite, coeli, et auribus percipe, terra ; quoniam Do- minus locutus est : Filios enu- trivi, et exaltavi : ipsi autem spreverunt me. Cognovit bos possessorem suum, et asinus prsesepe domini sui : Israel autem me non cognovit, et populus meus non intellexit. Vse genti peccatrici, populo gravi iniquitate, semini ne- quam, filiis sceleratis. Dere- liquerunt Dominum, blas- phemaverunt Sanctum Is- rael, abalienati sunt retror- sum. Super quo percutiam vos ultra, addentes prsevari- cationem 1 Omne caput lan- guidum, et omne cor mce- rens. A planta pedis usque ad verticem non est in eo sanitas : vulnus, et livor et plaga tumens non est cir- cumligata, nee curata medi- camine, neque f ota oleo.

Beginning of the Book of the Prophet Isaias. Ch. I. The vision of Isaias, the son of Amos, which he saw concerning Juda and Jerusa- lem, in the days of Ozias, Joathan, Achaz, and Eze- chias, Kings of Juda. Hear, O ye heavens, and give ear, O earth, for the Lord hath spoken : I have brought up children, and exalted them : but they have despised me. The ox knoweth his owner, and the ass his master's crib : but Israel hath not known me, and my people hath not understood. Wo to the sin- ful nation, a people laden with iniquity, a wicked seed, ungracious children. They have forsaken the Lord, they have blasphemed the Holy One of Israel, they are gone away backwards. For what shall I strike you any more, you that increase trangres- sion 1 The whole head is sick, and the whole heart is sad. From the sole of the foot unto the top of the head, there is no soundness therein ; wounds, and bruises, and swelling sores ; they are not bound up, nor dressed, nor fomented with oil.

FIRST SUNDAY OP ADVENT. 129

These words of the holy Prophet, or rather of God who speaks to us by the Prophet, should make a deep impression on the children of the Church, at this opening of the holy period of Advent. Who could hear without trembling this voice of our Lord, who is despised and unknown even at the very time when he is come to visit his people ? Lest men should be terrified at the splendour of his Majesty, he divested himself of it ; and^far from acknowledg- ing the divine power of Him who thus humbled himself out of love to them, these men have refused even to know him ; and the crib, where he lay after his birth, had, at first, but two dumb animals to honour or notice it. Do you feel, Christians, how just are the complaints which your God here makes \ and how your indifference for all his love is an insult ? He calls heaven and earth to witness ; he utters anathema against the sinful nation, his ungrateful children. Let us honestly confess that we, too, have not known the value of our Jesus' visit to us, and that we have but too faithfully imitated the obduracy of the Jews, who heeded not. the bright Light when it burst upon their darkness. In vain did the Angels sing on that December night ; in vain did shepherds receive and welcome the invitation to adore the Babe and know him ; in vain did the Magi come from the East, asking where they were to find the Crib of the King that was born. At this last example, the city of Jerusalem was somewhat moved ; but the astonish- ment was only for a moment, and the old indifference soon stifled the good tidings.

Thus it is, O Jesus, that thou comest unto dark- ness, and darkness does not comprehend thee. We beseech thee, let our darkness comprehend the Light, and desire it. The day will come when thou wilt disperse the spiritual and voluntary darkness of men by the awful light of thy justice. Thy glory, O Sovereign Judge, will be magnificent on that day, and

130 ADVENT.

we love to think upon thy having it : — but during these days of our life on earth, deliver us from thy wrath. We are one great wound from the sole of the foot unto the top of the head ; thou knowest not where to strike : — be, then, a Saviour, O Jesus, in this Coming, for which we are now preparing. The whole head is sick, and the whole heart is sad : come, and raise up this head which shame and vile passions bow down to the earth. Come, and comfort this heart oppressed with sin and fear. We confess it, our wounds are deep and sore ; come, thou Good Samaritan, pour in thy soothing oil and heal them.

The whole world is in expectation of its Redeemer ; come, dear Jesus, show thyself to it by granting it salvation. The Church, thy spouse, is now com- mencing another year, and her first word is to thee, a word which she speaks in the anxious solicitude of a mother for the safety of her children; she cries out to thee, saying : Come ! No, we will go no further in our journey through the desert of this life without thee, O Jesus ! Time is passing quickly away from us ; our day is perhaps far spent, and the shades of our life's night are fast coming on ; arise, O divine Sun of Justice ; Come ! guide our steps, and save us from eternal death.

MASS.

Whilst the Priest is approaching the altar, there to offer up the Holy Sacrifice, the Church opens her chants by this beautiful one, which so well expresses her confidence as the beloved Spouse of Jesus. Let us repeat it together with her, and let the heart be in harmony with our voice, for the Saviour comes to each of us in proportion to the earnestness of our longing for him.

FIRST SUNDAY OF ADVENT.

131

INTROIT.

To thee have I lifted up my soul : in thee, 0 my God, I put my trust, let me not be ashamed : neither let my enemies laugh at me : for none of them that wait on thee shall be confounded.

Ps. Show, O Lord, thy ways to me, and teach me thy paths.

~ff. Glory be to the Father, and to the Son, and to the Holy Ghost. As it was in the beginning, is now, and ever shall be, world without end. Amen.

Repeat: To thee.

Ad te levavi animam meam ; Deus meus, in te confido, non erubescam ■ neque irrideant me inimici mei : etenim universi qui te exspectant non conf undentur.

Ps. Vias tuas, Domine, demonstra mihi : et semitas tuas edoce me.

f. Gloria Patri, et Filio, et Spiritui Sancto. Sicut erat in principio, et nunc et semper, et in sascula saeculorum.

Amen.

Repeat : Ad te levavi.

After the Kyvie eleison, the Priest embodies in the following prayers, called on that account the Collects, all the desires and petitions of the Church for this first Sunday :

COLLECT.

Exert, we beseech thee, O Lord, thy power, and come : that by thy protection we may be freed from the immi- nent dangers of our sins, and be saved by thy mercy. Who liveth and reigneth with God the Father, in the unity of the Holy Ghost, God, world without end.

1$. Amen.

Excita qusesumus, Do- mine, potentiam tuam et veni : ut ab imminentibus peccatorum nostrorum peri- culis, te mereamur prote- gente eripi, te liberante sal- vari. Qui vivis et re^nas cum Deo Patre in unitate Spiritus Sancti, Deus, per omnia saecula saeculorum.

1$. Amen.

It is right that we should also beg, during this holy season, the all-powerful mediation of Her who, at first, was the sole depository of the great secret

132

ADVENT.

which was to give life to the world, with the Priest :

Let us then say

IN HONOUR OF THE BLESSED VIRGIN.

Deus, qui de beatae Marias Virginis utero Verbuni tuum Angelo nuntiante, carnem suscipere voluisti : prsesta supplicibus tuis ; ut, qui vere earn Genitricem Dei credimus, ejus apud te inter- cession ibus adjuvemur.

O God, who wast pleased that thy Word, when the Angel delivered his message, should take flesh in the womb of the Blessed Virgin Mary, give ear to our humble petitions, and grant that we who believe her to be truly the Mother of God, may be helped by her prayers.

To this is immediately added one of the following Prayers :

AGAINST THE PERSECUTORS OF THE CHURCH.

Ecclesiae fuse, qusesumus, Dofnine, preces placatns ad- mitte : ut, destructis adver- sitatibus et erroribus univer- sis, secura tibi serviat liber- tate. Per Dominum.

Mercifully hear, we be- seech thee, O Lord, the prayers of thy Church : that, all oppositions and errors being removed, she may serve thee with a secure liberty. Through, dec.

FOR THE POPE.

O God, the Pastor and Puler of all the faithful, look down, in thy mercy, on thy servant N., whom thou hast appointed Pastor over thy Church ; and grant, we be- seech thee, that both by word and example, he may edify all those that are under his charge ; and with the flock intrusted to him, arrive at length at eternal happiness.

put ye on the Lord Jesus Dominum Jesum Christum. Christ.

The Saviour, then, who is coming to us is the clothing which we are to put on over our spiritual nakedness. Here let us admire the goodness of our God, who, remembering that man hid himself after his sin, because he was naked, vouchsafes himself to become man's clothing, and cover with the robe of his Divinity the misery of human nature. Let us, therefore, be on the watch for the day and the hour when he will come to us, and take precautions against the drowsiness which comes of custom and self-indulgence. The light will soon appear; may its first rays be witness of our innocence, or at least of our repentance. If our Saviour is coming to put over our sins a covering which is to hide them for ever, the least that we, on our part, can do, is to retain no further affection for those sins, else it will be said of us that we refused our salvation. The last words of this Epistle were those which caught

134

ADVENT.

the eye of St. Augustine, when, after a long resist- ance to the grace which pressed him to give himself to God, he resolved to obey the voice which said to him : Telle lege ; take and read. They decided his conversion ; he immediately resolved to abandon the worldly life he had hitherto led, and put on Christ Jesus. Let us begin this very day, and imitate this Saint. Let us long for that dear and glorious Clothing, with which the mercy of our heavenly Father is so soon to cover us, and say with the Church these touching words, which we cannot repeat too often during this time of the year :

GRADUAL.

Universi qui te exspectant, non confundentur, Domine.

$\ Vias tuas, Domine, notas fac mihi : et semitas tuas edoce me.

Alleluia, Alleluia.

$"„ Ostende nobis, Domine, misericordiam tuam : et Sa- lutare tuum da nobis. Alle- luia.

None of them that wait on thee shall be confounded, O Lord.

f. Show, O Lord, thy ways to me : and teach me thy paths.

they shall see the Son of Man coming in a cloud with great power and majesty. But when these things begin to come to pass look up, and lift up your heads ; because your redemption is at hand. And he spoke to them a simi- litude : See the fig-tree and all the trees : when they now shoot forth their fruit, you know that summer is nigh. So you also, when you shall see these things come to pass, know that the kingdom of God is at hand. Amen, I say to you, this generation shall not pass away till all things be fulfilled. Heaven and earth shall pass away ; but my words shall not pass away.

Ita et vos cum videritis haec fieri, scitote quoniam prope est regnum Dei. Amen dico vobis : quia non praeteribit generatio haec, donee omnia fiant. Ccelum et terra transibunt : verba autem mea non transibunt.

Thou art to come, then, O Jesus, in all the terror of the Last Judgment, and when men least expect thee ! In a few days, thou art coming to us to clothe our misery with the garment of thy mercy ; a gar- ment of glory and immortality to us ; but thou art to come again on a future day, and in such dread majesty, that men will wither away with fear. 0 my Saviour ! condemn me not on that day of the world's destruction. Visit me now in thy love and mercy ; I am resolved to prepare my soul. I desire that thou shouldst come and be born within me, so that when the convulsions of nature warn me of thy coming to judge me, I may lift up my head, as thou biddest thy faithful disciples do, who, when the rest of men shall tremble at the thunder of thy Judgment, will have confidence in thee, because they have thee in their hearts.

During the offering of the Bread and Wine, the

Church, with her look steadfastly fixed on Him who is to come, keeps to her sweet canticle :

OFFERTORY.

Ad te levavi animam meam : Deus meus, in te confido, non erubescam ; neque irrideant me inimici mei : etenim universi, qui te exspectant, non confunden- tur.

To thee, O Lord, have I lifted up my soul : in thee, O my God, I put my trust, let me hot be ashamed ; neither let my enemies laugh at me : for none of them that wait on thee shall be con- founded.

After the oblation, she silently presents to God the petitions of all her children by the following Prayers :

MONDAY

OF THE FIRST WEEK OF ADVENT.

Come, let us adore tbe King our Lord, who is to come.

From the Prophet Isaias.

ck i.

Wash yourselves, be clean, take away the evil of your devices from my eyes : cease to do perversely, learn to do well : seek judgment, relieve the oppressed, judge for the fatherless, defend the widow. And then come, and accuse me, saith the Lord. If your sins be as scarlet, they shall be made as white as snow ; and if they be red as crimson, they shall be white as wool.

Regem venturum Domi- num, venite, adoremus.

De Isaia Propheta.

Cap I.

Lavamini, mundi estote, auferte malum cogitationum vestrarum ab oculis meis : quiescite agere perverse, dis- cite benefacere : quserite judicium, subvenite oppresso, judicate pupillo, defendite vidnam. Et venite, et argnite me. dicit Dominus. Si fue- rint peccata vestra ut coc- cinum, quasi nix dealbabun- tur : et si fuerint rubra quasi vermiculus, velut lana alba erunt.

The Saviour, who is so soon to be with us and to save us, warns us not on]y to prepare ourselves to appear before him, bat also to purify our souls. " It " is most just," says St. Bernard, " that the soul, which " was the first to fall, should be the first to rise. " Let us therefore defer caring for the body, until " the day when Jesus Christ will come and reform it " by the Resurrection ; for, in the first Coming, the " Precursor says to us : Behold the Lamb of God, " ivho taketh away the sins of the world. Observe, " he says not the maladies of the body, nor the mise- " ries of the flesh; he says sins, which are the malady " of the sou and the corruption of the spirit. Take

" heed then, thou my Body, and wait for thy turn " and time. Thou canst hinder the salvation of the " soul, and thine own safety is not within thy reach. " Let the soul labour for herself, and strive thou too " to help her, for if thou sharest in her sufferings, " thou wilt share in her glory. Retard her per- " fection, and thou retardest thine own. Thou wilt " not be regenerated until God sees his own Image " restored in the soul." 1 Let us, then, purify our souls. Let us do the works of the spirit, not the deeds of the flesh. Our Saviour's promise is most clear ; he will turn the deep dye of our iniquities into the purest whiteness. He asks but one thing of us : that we sin no more. He says to us : Cease to do perversely, and then come and accuse me, come and complain against me if I do not cleanse you. O Jesus ! we will not defer a single day of this holy season, — we accept, from this moment, the conditions thou offerest us. We sincerely desire to make our peace with thee ; to bring the flesh into subjection to our spirit, to make good all the injus- tice we have committed against our neighbour, and to hush, by the sighs of our heart-felt compunction, that voice of our sins which has so long cried to thee for vengeance,

Thou didst descend to these depths of our misery, yet not leaving thine own high throne above.

Then, by thy own gratui- tous love, assuming our hu- man nature,

Thou didst save all on earth that was lost.

Come, O Christ, purify our souls and bodies,

And make them thy own pure abode.

Justify us by thy first coming.

And in thy second, deliver us ;

That so, when thou judgest all things, on the day of the great light,

We may be adorned with a spotless robe, and may follow thy footsteps wheresoever they are seen. Amen.

O Almighty God ! grant, we beseech thee, unto all this thy family, the desire of meeting, by good works, thy Son, Christ our Lord, who is coming to us ; that being placed on his right hand, we may deserve the possession of the heavenly Kingdom. Through the same Christ our Lord. Amen.

OF THE FIRST WEEK OF ADVENT.

Regem venturum Domi- num, venite, adoremus.

De Isaia Propheta. Cap. II. Verbum, quod vidit Isaias filius Amos, super Judam et Jerusalem. Et erit in novis- simis diebus prseparatus mons domus Domini in ver- tice montium, et elevabitur super colles : et fluent ad eum omnes Gentes. Et ibunt populi multi, et di- cent : Venite, et ascendamus ad montem Domini et ad domum Dei Jacob : et doce- bit nos vias suas : et ambu- labimus in semitis ejus, quia de Sion exibit lex, et verbum Domini de Jerusalem.

Come, let us adore the King our Lord, who is to come.

From the Prophet Isaias. Ch. II.

The word that Isaias the son of Amos saw concerning Juda and Jerusalem. And in the last days the moun- tain of the house of the Lord shall be prepared on the top of mountains, and it shall be exalted above the hills : and all nations shall flow unto it. And many peop]e shall go, and say : Come and let us go up to the mountain of the Lord, and to the house of the God of Jacob : and he will teach us his ways : and we will walk in his paths, for the law shall come forth from Sion, and the word of the Lord from Jerusalem.

How the Church loves to hear and say these grand words of the Prophet : Come let us go up to the Mountain of the Lord ! She repeats them in the Lauds of every Feria in Advent ; and her children bless the Lord, who, that we might have no difficulty in finding him, has made himself like to a high mountain ; high, indeed, yet can we all ascend it. It is true that, at first, this mountain is, as we learn from another Prophet, a small stone

which is scarce perceptible, and this to show the humility of the Messias at his birth ; but it soon becomes great, and all people see it, and are invited to dwell on its fertile slopes, yea, to go up to its very summit, bright wdth the rays of the Sun of Justice. It is thus, 0 Jesus, that thou callest us all, and that thou approachest towards all, and the great- ness and sublimity of thy mysteries are put within the reach of our littleness. We desire to join, with- out delay, that happy multitude of people which is journeying on towards thee; we are already with them; we are resolved to fix our tent under thy shadow, O Mountain ever blessed ! There shelter us, and let us be out of reach of the noise of the world beneath us. Suffer us to go so far up, that we may lose all sight of that same world's vanities. May we never forget those paths which lead even to the bliss- ful summit, where the mountain, the figure, disap- pears, and the soul finds herself face to face with Him, whose vision eternally keeps the Angels in rapture, and whose delight is to be with the children of men !l

Let the Angels rejoice, let all nations exult ; He that is high is coming in lowliness to save what had been lost.

A God-man is born, and the Holy Trinity reigns ; the Son co-eternal with the Fa- ther, our Lord, descends upon our earth.

Let the Prophets cry out, and prophesy : Emmanuel is nigh unto us. Let the tongues of the dumb speak, and ye, poor lame ones, run to meet him.

Let the lamb and the wild beast feed with each other : let the ox and the ass know Him that lies in the manger.

O God, whose nature* and property is goodness, and with whom there is no change, be propitious to our prayers, and show to thy Church that mercy of thine which we confess : show to thy people the wonderful mystery of thy Only-Begotten Son : that thus, what thou hast pro- mised by the Gospel of thy Word, may be fulfilled by all nations coming to the faith, and the testimony of truth be verified by the completion of adoption.

De Isaia Propheta. Cap. III. Ecce enim dominatur Do- minus exercituum auferet a J erusalem et a Juda validum et f ortem, omne robur panis, et omne robur aquae ; fortem, virum bellatorem, judicem et prophetam, et ariolum, et senem principem super quin- quaginta, et honorabilem vultu, et consiliarium, et sa- pientem de architectis, et prudentem eloquii mystici. Et dabo pueros principes eorum ; et effoaminati domi- nabuntur eis. Ruit enim Jerusalem, et Judas conci- dit, quia lingua eorum et ad- inventiones eorum contra Dominum, provocarunt ocu- los majestatis ejus. Agnitio vultus eorum respondit eis, et peccatum suum quasi So- doma prsedicaverunt, nee absconderunt. Ya3 animse eorum, quoniam reddita sunt eis mala ! Dicite justo quo- niam bene, quoniam fructum adinventionum suarum co- medat. Vae impio in malum !

Come, let us adore the King our Lord, who is to come.

From the Prophet Isaias. Ch. III.

For behold the sovereign the Lord of hosts shall take away from Jerusalem and from Juda the valiant and the strong, the whole strength of bread, and the whole strength of water ; the strong man, and the man of war, the judge and the prophet, and the cunning man, and the ancient, the captain over fifty, and the honourable in countenance, and the coun- sellor, and the architect, and the skilful in eloquent speech. And I will give children to be their princes ; and the effeminate shall rule over them. For Jerusalem is ruined, and Juda is fallen, because their tongue and their devices are against the Lord, to provoke the eyes of his majesty. The show of their countenance hath an- swered them, and they have proclaimed abroad their sin as Sodom, and they have not hid it. Wo to their souls, for

be given him.

Jerusalem is tending to her destruction ; there- fore she is losing all power, and, with the rest, the power of understanding. She no longer knows whither she is going, and she sees not the abyss into which she is plunging. Such are all those men, who never give a thought to the Coming of the Sovereign Judge ; they are men of whom Moses said in his Can- ticle : They are a nation without counsel and with- out wisdom : 0 that they would be wise and would understand,, and would provide for their last end ! The Son of God comes now in the swaddling-clothes of a weak Babe, in the humility of a servant, and, to speak with the Prophets, as the dew which falls softly drop by drop ; but it will not always be so. This earth also, which now is the scene of our sins and our hardheartedness, will perish before the face of the angry Judge; and if we have made it the one object of our love, to what shall we then cling ? "A sudden " death which has happened in your presence," says St. John Chrysostom, " or an earthquake, or the bare " threat of some dire calamity, terrify and prostrate "you : what then shall it be when the whole earth " shall sink beneath your feet ; when you shall see " all nature in disorder ; when you shall hear the "sound of the last trumpet; when the Sovereign " Master of the universe shall appear before you in " the fulness of his Majesty ? Perchance, you have " seen criminals dragged to punishment : did they " not seem to die twenty times before they reached " the place of execution, and before the executioner " could lay his hands on them, fear had crushed out

" life?" Oh ! the terror of that Last Day ! How is it that men can expose themselves to such misery, when, to avoid it, they have but to open their hearts to Him, who is now coming to them in gentlest love, asking them to give him a place in their souls, and promising to shelter them from the wrath to come if they will but receive him ! O Jesus, who can withstand thy anger at the Last Day? Now thou art our Brother, our Friend, a Little Child who is to be born for us : we will therefore make cove- nant with thee ; so that, loving thee now in thy first Coming, we may not fear thee in the second. When thou comest in that second one, bid thy Angels approach us, and say to us those thrilling words : It is well !

That when from his tribu- nal the Judge shall condemn the wicked to the flames, and lovingly call the good to the heaven they have won,

We may not be hurled into the dark pool of fire, but, ad- mitted to the Vision of God, may enjoy the bliss of heaven.

PRAYER FROM THE MOZARABIC MISSAL. {In the Mass of the Fourth Sunday of Advent, Illation.)

It is meet and just, and available to us in all things, that we always should extol, by all possible praises, thy clemency, O Almighty Fa- ther ; who didst create us in holiness and nobleness, and, when the fraud of the old serpent had seduced us, didst "in pure mercy deliver us from death. Thou didst foretel, in past ages, that the Son, whom thou wast to send in the flesh for us, would come on this earth and would be born of a Virgin, and by thy holy pro- phets didst foretel the advent of his birth ; and this to the end that he, who had been promised, having been long expected, might give great joy to the world when he should come in the fulness of time. Wherefore we pray and beseech thee, that thou, who didst not suffer thy creature to perish, because thou art truly compassionate and mer- ciful, but didst restore what was lost by the humble com- ing of thy Son, wouldst now so protect, so keep, so heal, so defend, so free, what thou hast found and repaired and restored, that in that dread

THURSDAY

OF THE FIRST WEEK OF ADVENT.

Come, let us adore the King our Lord, who is to come.

From the Prophet Isaias. Gh. V.

I will sing to my beloved the canticle of my cousin concerning his vineyard. My. beloved had a vineyard on a hill, in a fruitful place. And he fenced it in, and picked the stones out of it, and planted it with the choicest wines, and built a tower in the midst thereof, and set up a wine press there- in : and he looked that it should bring forth grapes, and it brought forth wild grapes. And now, O ye in- habitants of Jerusalem, and ye men of Juda, judge be- tween me and my vineyard. What is there that I ought to do more to my vineyard, that I have not done to it 1 Was it that I looked that it should bring forth grapes, and it hath brought forth wild grapes 1 And now I will show you what I will do to my vineyard : I will take away the hedge thereof, and it shall be wasted ; I will break down the wall thereof, and it shall be trodden down. And I will make it desolate :

Et sepivit earn, et lapides elegit ex ilia, et plantavit earn electam, et aeclificavit turrim in medio ejus et torcular extruxit in ea : et exspec- tavit ut faceret uvas, et fecit labruscas. Nunc ergo habi- tatores Jerusalem, et viri Juda, judicate inter me et vineam meam.

cium, et ecce iniquitas ; et it shall not be pruned, and it i ustitiam, et ecce clamor. shall not be digged, but briars

and thorns shall come up, and I will command the clouds to rain no rain upon it. For the vineyard of the Lord of hosts is the house of Israel, and the man of Juda his pleasant plant : and I looked that he should do judgment, and behold iniquity ; and do justice, and behold a cry.

We are awaiting the Birth of a Child who is to appear seven hundred years after the time of Isaias ; and this Child will be the world's Saviour. Men will persecute him, load him with calumnies and injuries, and, but a few hours before they crucify him, they shall hear this parable from his lips : There was a man, a householder, who planted a vineyard, and made a hedge round about it, and, dug in it a press, and built a tower, and let it out to husbandmen : and went into a strange country. And ivhen the time of the fruits drew nigh, he sent his servants to the husbandmen, that they might receive the fruits thereof And the husbandmen laying hands on his servants, beat one, and killed another, and stoned another. Again he sent other servants more than the former ; and they did to them in like manner. And last of all, he sent to them his son, saying : They will reverence my son.1 See, Christians, this Son is coming to you. Will you reverence him ? Will you treat him as the Son of God, with that honour and love which are due to him ? Take notice of the wickedness of men ; it has a progress in malice. In the days of Isaias, the Jews despised the Prophets ; but the Prophets, though sent by God, were only men. The Son of God came, and

1 St. Matth. xxi. 33-37.

FIRST THURSDAY OF ADVENT. 155

they would not acknowledge him ; a far greater crime, assuredly, than to stone the Prophets. What, then, would be the crime of Christians, who not only acknowledge him who is now coming to them, but are his members by Baptism, if they will not open their hearts to this Messias, whom the Father is sending into the vineyard \ What punishment would not the ungrateful vine deserve, planted, as it has been, with so much love, should it persist in yielding nothing but bitter fruit ? Ah, dear Jesus ! let not this be : make us generous : make us produce abundant flower and fruit for the day of thy Coming, which is so near at hand.

See, O Lord, the affliction of thy people, and send Him whom thou hast promised to send. Send forth the Lamb, the ruler of the earth, from the rock of the desert to the mount of the daughter of Sion, that himself may take off the yoke of our captivity.

Drop down dew, ye hea- vens, from above, and let the clouds rain the Just One.

Be comforted, be com- forted, my people • thy sal- vation shall speedily come : why wilt thou waste away in sadness 1 why hath sorrow seized thee 1 1 will save thee ; fear not : for I am the Lord thy God, the Holy One of Israel, thy Bedeemer.

Drop down dew, ye hea- vens, from above, and let the clouds rain the Just one.

Almighty and everlasting God, who, by the Coming of thine only begotten Son our Lord Jesus Christ, didst deign to shine on us with a new light ; grant unto us, that as we deserved to have him as our companion in the form of our body, by the Birth the Virgin gave him ; so also we may merit to be his companions in the king- dom of his grace : who liveth and reigneth with thee for ever and ever. Amen.

FRIDAY

OF THE FIRST WEEK OF ADVENT.

Come, let us adore the King our Lord, who is to come.

From the Prophet Isaias. Ch. VI.

In the year that King Ozias died, I saw the Lord sitting upon a throne high and ele- vated : and his train filled the temple. Upon it stood the Seraphim : the one had six wings, and the other had six wings : with two they covered his face, and with two they covered his feet, and with two they flew. And they cried one to another, and said : Holy, Holy, Holy the Lord God of Hosts : all the earth is full of his glory.

Regem venturum Domi- lium, venite, adoremus.

De Isaia Propheta. Cap. VI. In anno, quo mortuus est rex Ozias, vidi Dominum se- dentem super solium excel- sum et elevatum : et ea quae sub ipso erant, replebant templum. Seraphim stabant super illud : sex alas uni, et sex alse alteri : duabus vela- bant faciem ejus, et duabus velabant pedes ejus, et dua- bus volabant. Et clamabant alter ad alterum, et dicebant : Sanctus, Sanctus, Sanctus Dominus Deus exercituum : plena est omnis terra gloria ejus.

Such is the glory of the Lord in the highest heavens : who could see it and live ? But now, con- template this same Lord upon our earth, during the days which have dawned upon us. The womb of a Virgin contains Him, whom heaven cannot contain. To Angels his beauty is visible, but it dazzles them not; to men, it is not even visible. Not a single voice is heard saying unto him those words of heaven: Holy, Holy, Holy is the Lord God of Hosts! The Angels no longer say of him : All the earth is full of his glory ; for the earth is witness of his abasement, and an abasement so abject and low, that the inhabitants of the earth do not even know

it. At first, there was but one who knew the divine secret^ — the Virgin Mother; after her, Elizabeth was admitted to know that her cousin was Mother of God ; and then, after the most painful and humiliat- ing suspicions, the great mystery was revealed by an Angel to Joseph. So that only three on earth know that God has come down upon it ! Thus humbly did he re-enter the world, after the sin of pride had driven him out of it. O God of the ancient Covenant, how great thou art ! and who would not tremble before thee ? O God of the new Covenant, how little thou hast made thyself! who would not love thee ? Heal my pride, the source of all my sins! teach me to value what thou didst so much value. By thy Incarnation thou dost a second time create the world; and in this second creation, more excellent than the first, thou workest by silence, and thy triumph is won by self- annihilation. I wish to humble myself after thine example, and to profit by the lessons which a God came down so low to give me. Lay low all that is high and lifted up within me, 0 my Jesus, for this is one of the ends of thy Coming. I abandon myself to thee, as to my Sovereign Master ! do with me and in me what thou wilt.

Let us play loud on our cymbals, let us shout our songs of victory ; Christ is to appear visibly; the predic- tions of the Prophets are ful- filled ; He, who they foretold would appear amongst mor- tals, is to be born in a holy cave, and to lie in a crib a little child.

Get thou ready, 0 Beth- lehem ! Eden, open thy gates ! Land of Juda, put on thy best ! Let the heavens be glad, let men exult ! To enrich the poverty of Adam by the abundance of his mercy, Life is in that crib, the Rich One is in that cave, yet the Divine Nature suffers no change nor confusion.

From the dawn of day I watch for thee, who, in mercy for fallen man, didst empty thyself, yet still remaining God, and didst take from a Virgin the form of a servant, O thou Word of God, O Lover of men ! I beseech thee, give me peace.

Let the clouds drop down dew from on high. He who puts the clouds in the air, he the adorable God, has de- scended in a cloud, and that cloud is the Virgin : he has done this, that light everlast- ing may shine from him on those who heretofore were in darkness and peril.

O most sweet Child, how shall I feed thee ? said the Blessed Lady. How shall I take thee into my arms, thou that holdest all things in thy power1? How shall I wrap

PRAYER FROM THE MOZARABIC MISSAL.

{In the Mass of the Fifth Sunday of Advent.)

In proximo quidem est, Domine, Dies adventus tui : sed quaesumus ut, antequam venias, expiari mereamur ab omni contagion e delicti. Prius dilue, rogamus in nobis omne quod in ilia futura ex- aminatione puniturus es ; ut cum Justus adveneris judex, non in nobis invenias quod condemnes.

The day of thy Coming, O Lord, is near, indeed, at hand ; but before thou com- est, we beseech thee make us worthy to be purified from every contagion of sin. First remove from us, we entreat thee, whatsoever there is in us which thou wouldst have to punish in that future ex- amination ; that so, when thou comest as our just Judge, thou may est find naught in us to condemn.

FIRST SATURDAY OF ADVENT.

SATUKDAY

OF THE FIRST WEEK OF ADVENT.

Come, let us adore the King our Lord, who is to come.

From the Prophet Isaias. Ch. VII.

And the Lord spoke again to Achaz, saying : Ask thee a sign of the Lord thy God, either unto the depth of hell, or unto the height above. And Achaz said : I will not ask, and I will not tempt the Lord. And he said : Hear ye, therefore, O house of David : Is it a small thing for you to be grievous to men, that you are grievous to my God also 1 Therefore, the Lord himself shall give you a sign. Behold, a Virgin shall conceive and bear a Son, and his name shall be called Emmanuel.

Let our hearts be filled with hope and joy at hear- ing this fair and sweet prophecy : A Virgin shall conceive and bear a Son. These words contain the salvation of the world, as these others express its perdition : The woman took of the fruit of the tree, and did eat, and gave unto her husband. This Virgin promised to us is at length come : the divine Fruit is in her womb. By her, Eve's disobedience is repaired, the world is raised from its fall, the head of the serpent is crushed, God himself is more

De Isaia Propheta. Cap. VII. Et adjecit Dominus loqui ad Achaz, dicens : Pete tibi signum a Domino Deo tuo sive in profundum inferni, sive in excelsum supra. Et dixit Achaz : Non petam, et non tentabo Dominum. Et dixit : Audite ergo domus David : Numquid parum vo- bis est molestos esse homini- bus, quia molesti estis et Deo meo 1 Propter hoc dabit Dominus ipse vobis signum : Ecce Virgo concipiet, et pa- riet Filium : et vocabitur nomen ejus Emmanuel.

glorified by the fidelity of this second Virgin, than he had been outraged by the disobedience of the first. The consent of Mary exercises an immense influence in the saving of the world. It is true that the Word himself is coming ; " but," says St. Bernard. " Mary " is the way whereby he comes ; it is from her virginal " womb he issues, as the Bridegroom from the nuptial " chamber. Let us endeavour, therefore, to go up to " Jesus by Mary, for Jesus came down to us by her. "By thee, O Blessed one that didst find Grace, O " Parent of Life, 0 Mother of Saltation, may we have " access to thy Son ! May He, who was given to us " by thee, receive us by thee. May he admit thy "purity, and, for its sake, forgive our impurities; " may he give us the pardon of our pride, because of " the pleasure he took in thy humility. May thy " abundant charity cover the multitude of our sins. " May thy glorious fruitfulness get us fruitfulness of " merit. Our Lady ! our Mediatrix ! our Advocate ! " reconcile us to thy Son, commend us to thy Son, " present us to thy Son. By the grace thou didst find, " by the prerogative thou didst merit, by the Mercy " thou didst bring forth, grant, O Blessed Virgin ! "that Jesus, who deigned to become, through thy " maternity, partaker of our weakness and misery, " may, through thy intercession, make us partakers " of his glory and bliss."1

be speedily at his work ; may he stay the rights and laws of nature in the Virgin's de- livery.

May the King of glory, when born, triumph over nature ; may he reign and command ; may he take away from the midst of men all leaven and rust.

May he humble proud heads ; may this God, mighty in war, trample in his power on the necks of the haughty.

May he cast forth the prince of this world ; and make his Mother share with him the empire which his Father has given him.

Go forth, messenger of God, announce these gifts ; lift up, by the virtue of thy annunciation, the veil of the ancient Scripture.

Approach, tell thy an- nouncement : say, when thou art in her presence, Hail! Say : 0 full of grace ! Say : The Lord is with thee ! And then : Fear not !

May his firmness render us firm, lest human frailty- should make us stumble into the abyss.

But may the Giver of par- don, granting us pardon and grace, obtained by the Mother of grace, dwell within us.

May he that grants us par- don of our sins, wipe away all our guilt, and give us the country in the starry heaven.

Amen.

PRAYER FROM THE GALLICAN SACRAMENTARY.

{Christmas Eve.)

Emmanuel ,nobiscum Deus, Christe Filius Dei, qui cum ex Virgine te nasciturum pronuntias, quia Mariam matrem creasti ut Dominus, de qua natus es filius : da nobis ut, qui cum ilia a te, vel per te creati sumus ex ni- hilo, simili, ut ea, credulitatis remuneremur et prsemio.

O Emmanuel, God with us, Christ the Son of God, who didst announce that thou wouldst be born of a Virgin, and didst, as Lord, create Mary, the Mother whose Son thou art : grant us, that being, like her, created by thee out of nothing, we may be rewarded, like her, for our faith in thee.

SECOND SUNDAY OF ADVENT. 165

THE SECOND SUNDAY OF ADVENT.

The Office of this Sunday is filled, from beginning to end, with the sentiments of hope and joy, with which the soul should be animated at the glad tidings of the speedy coming of Him who is her Saviour and Spouse. The interior coming, that which is effected in the soul, is the almost exclusive object of the Church's prayers for this day : let as therefore open our hearts, let us prepare our lamps, and wait in gladness that cry, which will be heard in the mid- night : Glory be to God ! Peace unto men !

The Roman Church makes the Station to-day in the Basilica of Holy Cross-in-Jerusalem. It was in this venerable church that Constantine deposited a large piece of the True Cross, together with the Title which was fastened to it by Pilate's order, and which proclaimed the Kingly character of the Saviour of the world. These precious relics are still kept there ; and, thus enriched with such a treasure, the Basilica of Holy Cross-in-Jerusalem is looked upon, in the Roman Liturgy, as Jerusalem itself, as is evident from the allusions made in the several Masses of the Stations held in that Basilica. In the language of the sacred Scriptures and of the Church, Jerusalem is the image of the faithful soul ; and the Office and Mass of this Sunday have been drawn up on this idea, as the one of the day. We regret not to be able here to develop the sublime beauty of this figure ; and must proceed at once to the passage, which the Church has selected from the Prophet Isaias. There she tells her children how well-founded are her hopes in the merciful and peaceful reign of the Messias. But first let us adore this divine Messias :

De Isaia Propheta. Cap. XI.

Et egredietur virga de ra- dice Jesse, et flos de radice ejus ascendet. Et requiescet super eum Spiritus Domini, Spiritus sapientise et_ intel- lectus, Spiritus consiln et fortitudinis, Spiritus scien- tial et pietatis : et replebit eum Spiritus timoris Domi- ni.

Come, let us adore the King, our Lord, who is to come.

From the Prophet Isaias. Ck XI.

And there shall come forth a Branch out of the root of Jesse, and a Flower shall rise up out of his root. And the Spirit of the Lord shall rest upon him, the Spirit of wis- dom and of understanding, the Spirit of counsel and of fortitude, the Spirit of know- ledge and of godliness : and he shall be filled with the Spirit of the fear of the Lord. He shall not judge according to the sight of the eyes, nor reprove according to the hear- ing of the ears : but he shall judge the poor with justice, and shall reprove with equity for the meek of the earth. And he shall strike the earth with the rod of his mouth, and with the breath of his lips he shall slay the wicked. And justice shall be the gir- dle of his loins, and faith the girdle of his reins. The wolf shall dwell with the lamb, and the leopard shall lie down with the kid : the calf and the lion and the sheep shall abide together, and a little child shall lead them. The calf and the bear shall feed : their young ones shall rest together : and the lion shall eat straw like an ox. And the suckling child shall play on the hole of the asp : and the weaned child shall thrust his hand into the den of the basilisk. They shall not

In that day the root of Jesse, who standeth for an ensign of people, him the Gentiles shall beseech, and his sepul- chre shall be glorious.

How much is contained in these magnificent words of the Prophet ! The Branch ; the Flower that is to come from it ; the Spirit which rests on this flower ; the seven Gifts of this Spirit ; peace and confidence established on the earth ; and, throughout the world, one brotherhood in the kingdom of the Messias ! St. Jerome, whose words are read by the Church in the lessons of the Second Nocturn of this Sunday, says : " That the Branch which cometh forth from the root " of Jesse, is the Blessed Virgin Mary, who had con- " tact with no shrub or plant; and that the Flower " is the Lord Jesus, who says in the Canticle of Can- " tides : / am the Flower of the field, and the Lily " of the valley!' In every age of the Christian Church, this wonderful Branch and its divine Flower have been objects of enthusiastic veneration. In the Middle Ages, the Tree of Jesse, with its prophetic branches, wras carved on the cathedral porches, was painted on the windows, was embroidered on the hangings of the sanctuary, and the melodious voice of the priests sang its praises in the beautiful Re- sponsory composed by F albert of Chartres, and put to music by the devout King Robert.

The devout St. Bernard, commenting upon this Responsory in his second Advent Homily, says : " The Virgin's Son is the Flower, a Flower white and " ruddy, chosen out of thousands ; a Flower on whom " the Angels love to look ; a Flower whose fragrance " restores the dead ; a Flower, as himself assures us, " of the field, not of a garden : for the flowers of the " field bloom without man's care, no man has sown " their seed, no man has cultivated them. Just so " the Virgin's womb, a meadow verdant in an endless " spring, has brought forth a Flower, whose beauty " will never droop, whose freshness will never fade. " 0 Virgin, Branch sublime, to what a height art " thou grown ! Even up to Him that sitteth on " the Throne, even to the Lord of majesty. It was " sure to be so, for thou castest deep down the roots " of humilit}^ 0 plant of heaven indeed ! precious " above all, holier than all. 0 tree of life indeed ! " alone worthy to bear the fruit of salvation."

And of the Holy Spirit and his Gifts, what shall we say ? They rest and are poured out on the Messias only to the end that they may flow from him upon us; he needs them not; but we alone need Wisdom and Understanding, Counsel and Fortitude, Knowledge and Godliness, and Fear of the Lord. Let us ask with instance for this divine Spirit, by whose operation Jesus was conceived and born in Mary's womb, and let us beg of him to form Jesus within our hearts. But let us not forget to rejoice at those other glorious things which are told us by the Prophet, of the happiness, and peace, and de- lights, which are to be on the Holy Mountain. The world has been looking so many ages for peace ; it is now coming. Sin had put enmity and division every- where ; grace will bring unity. A little Child will be the pledge of an alliance between all nations.

SECOND SUNDAY OF ADVENT. 169

The Prophets have foretold it, the Sibyl has an- nounced it, and in Rome itself, buried as it is in Paganism, the prince of Latin poets has sung the celebrated poem, which, after all, is but the voice of the old tradition : " The last age, foretold by the " Cumean Sibyl, is at hand; a new race is being sent " down to earth from high heaven. The flocks shall " no more fear the fierce lions. The serpent shall be " no more : the treacherous plant, which yielded " poison, shall grow no more."1

Come, then, O Messias, and restore to the world its primitive peace ; but remember, we beseech thee, that it is in the heart of man that harmony has been broken more than elsewhere in thy creation : cure this heart, enter into possession of this Jerusalem, which thou lovest, though so unworthy : she has been too long captive in Babylon; lead her out of this strange land. Build up her temple again, and make the glory of this second temple to be greater than that of the first, by having thee to dwell in it, not in figure, but in the reality of thy adorable Person. The Angel said to Mary : The Lord God shall give unto thy Son the throne of David his father ; and he shall reign in the house of Jacob for ever'; and of his kingdom there shall be no end. What can we do, O Jesus, but say, with thy beloved disciple, at the close of his prophecy : Amen. Come, Lord Jesus !

ten for our learning : that through patience and the comfort of the Scriptures, we might have hope. Now the God of patience and of com- fort grant you to be of one mind one towards another, according to Jesus Christ : that with one mind and with one mouth you may glorify God and the Father of our Lord Jesus Christ. Where- fore receive one another as Christ also hath received you unto the honour of God. For I say that Christ Jesus was minister of the circumcision for the truth of God, to con- firm the promises made unto the fathers. But that the Gentiles are to glorify God for his mercy, as it is written : Therefore will I confess to thee, O Lord, among the Gentiles, and will sing to thy name. And again he saith : Rejoice ye Gentiles with his people. And again : Praise the Lord all ye Gentiles, and magnify him all ye people. And again Isaias saith : There shall be a root of Jesse, and he that shall rise up to rule the Gentiles, in him the Gen- tiles shall hope. Now the God of hope fill you with all joy and peace in believing : that you may abound in hope, and in the power of the Holy Ghost.

Here, Christians, is your instruction ; be patient, be firm in hope, and you shall delight in the God of peace, who is coming to you. But, take heed, you must have cordial charity one for the other ; it is the mark of the children of God. The Prophet tells us

nam scripta sunt : ut per patientiam et consolationem Scripturarum, spem habea- mus. Deus autem patientise et solatii det vobis idipsum sapere in alterutrum secun- dum Jesum Christum : ut unanimes uno ore honori- ficetis Deum, et Patrem Do- mini nostri Jesu Christi. Propter quod suscipite invi- cem, sicut et Christus susce- pit vos in honorem Dei. Dico enim Christum Jesum ministrum fuisse circumci- sionis propter veritatem Dei, ad confirmandas promissi- ones patrum. Gentes autem super misericordia honorare Deum, sicut scriptum est: Propterea confitebor tibi in Gentibus Domine, et nomini tuo cantabo. Et iterum di- cit : Lsetamini Gentes cum plebe ejus. Et iterum : Lau- date omnes Gentes Domi- num : et magnificate eum omnes populi. Et rursus Isaias ait : Erit radix Jesse ; et qui exsurget regere Gen- tes, in eum Gentes spera- bunt. Deus autem spei re- pleat vos omni gaudio, et pace in credendo : ut abundetis in spe, et virtute Spiritus Sancti.

that the Messias will make even wolf and lamb dwell together ; and now we have the Apostle showing us how this same Christ brings Jews and Gentiles into the one same family. Glory to this sovereign King, the powerful offspring of the root of Jesse, who now bids us hope in him ! Listen to the Church, she again tells us that he is about to show himself in Jerusalem.

Sequentia sancti Evangelii secundum Matthseum.

Cap. XL

In illo tempore : Cum au- disset Joannes in vinculis opera Christi, mittens duos de discipulis suis, ait illi : Tu es, qui venturus es, an ahum exspectamus ] Et re- spondens Jesus ait illis : Euntes renuntiate Joanni quae audistis, et vidistis. Casci vident, claudi ambu- lant, leprosi mundantur, surdi audiunt, mortui re- surgunt, pauperes evange- lizantur ; et beatus est, qui non fuerit scandalizatus in me. Illis autem abeuntibus, ccepit Jesus dicere ad turbas de Joanne : Quid existis in desertum videre] Arun-

Sequel of the holy Gospel according to Matthew.

Ch. XI. At that time : When John had heard in prison the works of Christ, sending two of his disciples, he said to him : Art thou he that art to come, or look we for another 1 And Jesus making answer, said to them : Go and relate to John what you have heard and seen. The blind see, the lame walk, the lepers are cleansed, the deaf hear, the dead rise again, the poor have the Gospel preached to them : and blessed is he that shall not be scandalized in me. And when they went their way, Jesus began to say to the multitude, concerning

written : Behold, I send my ante te. Angel before thy face, who shall prepare thy way before thee.

Thou art He that was to come, 0 Jesus ! We look for no other. We were blind, thou hast enlightened us ; we were lame, thou hast made us walk ; the leprosy of sin disfigured us, thou hast cleansed us ; we were deaf to thy words, thou hast given us hearing ; we were dead in sin, thou hast given us life again ; we were poor and had none to care for us, thou hast come to us with every aid and consolation. These have been, and will again be, the blessings of thy visit to our souls, O Jesus ! — a visit, silent but won- derful in its work ; which flesh and blood cannot understand, but which faithful hearts feel is granted them. Come, my Saviour, come to me ! thy conde- scension, and familiarity with such poverty as mine, shall not scandalise me ; thy workings in the souls of men are proof enough that thou art God. He alone, that created souls, can heal them.

After the Symbol of Faith has been chanted, when you see the Priest is about to make the offering of the Bread and Wine, unite with the Church in asking to be filled with life by the divine Guest, who is so soon to be with her.

Come, let us adore the King our Lord, who is to come.

From the Prophet Isaias.

Oh. XIII.

The burden of Babylon, which Isaias the son of Amos saw. Upon the dark moun- tain lift ye up a banner, exalt the voice, lift up the hand, and let the rulers go into the gates. I have commanded my sanctified ones, and have called my strong ones in my wrath, them that rejoice in my glory. The noise of the multitude in the mountains, as it were of many people : the noise of the sound of kings, of nations gathered together. The Lord of hosts hath given charge to the troops of war, to them that come from a country afar oif, from the end of heaven : the Lord and the instruments of his wrath, to destroy the whole land. Howl ye, for the day of the Lord is near, it shall come as a destruction from the Lord. Therefore shall all hands be faint, and every heart of man shall melt, and shall be broken. Gripings and pains shall take

Ego man- davi sanctificatis meis, et vocavi fortes meos in ira mea, exsultantes in gloria mea. Vox multitudinis in montibus, quasi populorum frequentium : vox sonitus regum, gentium congregata- rum. Dominus exercituum prsecepit militise belli, veni- entibus de terra procul a summitate cceli ; Dominus, et vasa furoris ejus, ut dis- perdat omnem terram. Ulu- late, quia prope est dies Do- mini, quasi vastitas a Do- mino veniet. Propter hoc omnes manus dissolventur, et omne cor hominis conta- bescet, et conteretur.

Quoniam stellae cceli, et splendor earum non expandent lumen suum : ob- tenebratus est sol in ortu suo, et luna non splendebit in lumine suo. Et visitabo su- per orbis mala, et contra im- pios iniquitatem eorum : et quiescere faciam superbiam infidelium, et arrogantiam f ortium humiliabo.

hold of them, they shall be in pain as a woman in labour : every one shall be amazed at his neighbour, their counte- nances shall be as faces burnt. Behold, the day of the Lord shall come, a cruel day, and full of indignation, and of wrath, and fury to lay the land desolate, and to destroy the sinners thereof out of it. For the stars of heaven, and their brightness shall not dis- play their light : the sun shall be darkened in his rising, and the moon shall not shine with her light. And I will visit the evils of the world, and against the wicked for their iniquity : and I will make the pride of infidels to cease, and bring down the arrogancy of the mighty.

The Church puts before us again, in the office of to-day, the terrible spectacle of the last Coming of Jesus Christ. The sinful Babylon, of which Isaias speaks, is the world grown old in its crimes ; the cruel day, full of indignation and wrath, is that on which the Messias will return to judge the world, with his Sign glittering in the clouds. The words used by the Prophet to describe the terror of the inhabitants of Babylon are so expressive, that it is difficult to meditate upon them seriously and not tremble. You, then, who, in this second week of preparation for the Birth of our Saviour, are still wavering and undecided as to what you intend to do for the day of his Coming, reflect upon the connec- tion that there is between the two Comings. If you receive your Saviour in the first, you need be in no fear for the second ; but if you despise the first, the second will be to your destruction, nor will the cries

SECOND MONDAY OF ADVENT. 179

of your despair save you. The Judge will come on a sudden, at mid-night, at the very time when you persuade yourself that he is far off from you.

Say not, that the end of the world is not yet come, and that the destinies of the human race are not filled up, — it is not the world that is here in question, it is you individually. True, the Day of the Lord will be terrible, when this world shall be broken up as a vessel of clay, and the remnants of creation shall be a prey to devouring flames ; but, long before that day of universal terror, your own day of judgment will come. The inexorable Judge will come to you, you will stand before his face, you will have none to defend you, and the sentence he will pass will be eternal ; and though the nature of that sentence, whether for or against you, will not be known to the rest of the world until the last and general judgment, still is this his Coming to you, at your own judgment, terrible above measure. Remember, therefore, that what will make the terror of the Last Day so great is, that then will be solemnly and publicly confirmed what was judged irrevocably, though secretly, between your own soul and her Judge ; just as the favourable sentence, which the good receive at the happy moment of their death, will be repeated before the immense assembly of men and Angels on the Last Day. Is it wise, then, Christians, to put off your conversion, on the plea of the Day of the Lord not having to come for ages, when it might be this night that your soul were required of you I1 The Lord is coming : lose no time, prepare to meet him ; an humble and contrite and converted heart is sure to find acceptance.

Her time is near at hand, and her days shall not be prolonged. For the Lord will have mercy on Jacob, and will yet choose out of Israel, and will make them rest upon their own ground : and the stranger shall be joined with them, and shall adhere to the house of Jacob. And the people shall take them, and bring them into their place : the house of Israel shall possess them in the land of the Lord for servants and handmaids : and they shall make them captives that had taken them, and shall subdue their op- pressors. And it shall come to pass in that day, that when God shall give thee rest from thy labour, and from thy vexation, and from the hard bondage, wherewith thou didst serve before, thou shalt take up this parable against the King of Babylon, and shalt say : " How is the op- pressor come to nothing, "the tribute hath ceased]

Lucifer, qui mane oriebaris 1 corruisti in terrain, qui vul- nerabas gentes : qui dicebas in corde tuo : In ceelum con- scendam ; super astra Dei exaltabo solium meum, se- debo in monte testament!, in lateribus Aquilonis : ascen- dam super altitudinem nubi- um, similis ero Altissimo. Verumtamen ad infernum detraheris in profundum laci.

" The Lord hath broken the " staff of the wicked, the rod " of the rulers, that struck "the people in wrath with "an incurable wound, that "brought nations under in "fury, that persecuted in a "cruel manner. How art " thou fallen from heaven, O "Lucifer, who didst rise in " the morning % how art thou "fallen to the earth, that " didst wound the nations : "and thou saidst in thy " heart : I will ascend into "heaven, I will exalt my "throne above the stars of " God, I will sit in the moun- " tain of the covenant, in the "sides of the North : I will " ascend above the height of " the clouds, I will be like the " Most High. But yet thou " shalt be brought down to "hell into the depth of the "pit."

Thy ruin, 0 Lucifer, is irreparable ! Thou re- fusedst to humble thyself before God, and thou wast cast into hell. Thy pride then sought a compensa- tion for this thy deep humiliation, and thou causedst the ruin of the human race, out of hatred for God and his creatures. Thou didst succeed in inspiring hirn, who was formed out of dust, with that same pride which had caused thine own destruction. By thee, sin came into this world, and by sin death : the human race seemed now a victim which never could escape thy vengeance. Forced to give up thy hopes of a heavenly royalty, thou aimedst to reign in Hell and destroy the creatures of God as they came from his creating love. But again thou art foiled and conquered. Thy reign was in pride ; pride alone

SECOND TUESDAY OF ADVENT. 185

could form thy court and give thee subjects ; now, see how the Sovereign Lord of all things uproots thy kingdom : he himself comes to teach his creatures humility, and he teaches it, not by laws given with awful majesty, as once on Sinai, but by himself meekly practising that heavenly humility, which alone can raise up them that had fallen by pride. Tremble, proud Spirit, thy sceptre is to be broken !

In thy haughty wisdom, thou disdainest this humble and lovely Virgin of Nazareth, who holds within her- self, in adoring silence, the mystery of thy ruin and our salvation. The Child she carries in her womb, and is so soon to be born, has long since been the ob- ject of thy contempt. Know, then, that God does not disdain this unborn Child, for this Child is also God I and a single act of adoration and devotedness to his Father, which he is making in the womb of Mary, gives more glory to the Divinity than all thy pride could rob it of, even were thy pride to increase for eternity. Henceforth, men, taught by the lessons of a God the immense power of humility, will have re- course to it as their great remedy. Instead of exalt- ing themselves, as thou didst, by a mad and guilty pride, they will humble themselves with love and pleasure: the lower they humble themselves, the higher will God raise them : the poorer they own themselves, the richer will he make them. It is the glorious Virgin that tells us this in her exquisite Canticle. May she be ever blessed, Mother so gentle and sweet to her children, and so terrible to thee, Lucifer ! that writhest beneath her as she crushes and conquers thee.

From the Prophet Isaias. Gh. XVI.

Send forth, O Lord, the Lamb the ruler of the earth, from Petra of the desert to the mount of the daughter of Sion. And it shall come to pass, that as a bird fleeing away, and as young ones flying out of the nest, so shall the daughters of Moab be in the passage of Arnon. Take council, gather a council, make thy shadow as the night in the mid-day: hide them that flee, and betray not them that wander about. My fugi- tives shall dwell with thee: O Moab, be thou a covert to them from the face of the destroyer. For the dust is at an end, the wretch is con- sumed, he hath failed that trod the earth under foot. And a throne shall be pre- pared in mercy, and one shall sit upon it in truth in the tabernacle of David, judging and seeking judgment, and quickly rendering that which is just.

Send forth to us, 0 Lord, the Lamb : "It is the Lamb," says Peter of Celles, " it is the Lamb we

Thou art, even now, in thy Mother's womb, the sovereign Ruler. This virginal womb is a throne of mercy whereon thou art seated in humility, ready to avenge our rights and confound our cruel enemy. O most dear King ! our eyes cannot yet behold thee, but our hearts tell us thou art near us. We know that it is for our sakes that thou hast put on this strange royalty. Suffer us to approach thee, and offer thee our homage and loyalty, even now that a cloud hides thee from our sight. A few days more, and thou wilt be seated on another throne, thy Mother's arms, and then all the earth will see the salvation that is sent unto it.

Audi, coelum, et intellige terra ; ecce enim Filius Ver- bumque Dei Patris progre- ditur ad nascendum ex Vir- gine inexperta virum, sine dolore ilium pariente et vir- tute Spiritus Sancti. Beth- lehem parare ; aperi januain, Eden : nam qui Est fit qui non erat, et plasturgus omnis creaturse plasmatur ipse, afferens mundo magnam misericordiam.

Lamb, in her womb ; and thou, O Crib, receive him who delivers us mortals by his word ineffably ; ye Shep- herds, keeping your night- watch, tell the wondrous miracle ; ye Magi, from Per- sia, bring to the King gold, incense, and myrrh ; for the Lord hath appeared, born of a Virgin Mother, before whom she herself falls down, and though his Mother, yet adores him as his lowly handmaid, and then taking him into her arms, she says unto him : O my Saviour, my God, how is it that thou earnest into me, and wast produced in me 1

Hear, 0 ye heavens, and thou, O earth, attend : the Son and Word of God the Father is to be born of a Virgin that knows not man, and travails not when giving him birth, for all is by the power of the Holy Ghost. Bethlehem, be ready ! Eden, open thy gates ! for he that Is is made what he was not, and he that formed all crea- tures receives himself a created form, bringing to the world plentiful mercy.

O thou that art immense by Nature, O Christ our King, how shall a little cave receive thee? How shall a crib contain thee, 0 Jesus, Son _ of a spotless Virgin, making thyself a stranger in thine own house, that thou mayest give salvation to them that harbour thee 1

cloud, Christ, the Sun of glory ; may he appear in the flesh, in the cave, shedding thence to the ends of the world his dazzling splendour, by his immense mercy.

Thou knowest, O merciful Jesus, our pains and misery, and thou despisest us not ; but emptiest thyself even before leaving thy Mother's virginal womb, where thou hast set thy tabernacle ; this thy Mother will travail not in giving thee birth in the cave, thou who art made flesh.

Mountains and hills, val- leys and plains, peoples and tribes, nations and every spirit, sing the song of vic- tory ! the fulness of a divine joy is coming, and all are to be redeemed, for the Word of God, who is beyond all time, is now made in time.

Now is coming towards us the heavenly vine, on which has ripened the im- mortal fruit ; she comes to produce for us the wine of joy, of which she will give us to drink : we will then sing to him, Blessed art thou, our God!

There is advancing the vessel bearing the divine per- fume, and she will place it in the cave of Bethlehem, and we, filled with the mystic fragrance, will sing, Blessed art thou, O God of our Fathers !

Thou, O Mary, art like that instrument which Isaias saw of old, holding in thy womb the Christ, who, like

PRAYER FROM THE MOZARABIC MISSAL.

{Second Sunday of Advent.)

Jucundatur, Domine, et tripudiat terra ; quia Ver- bum caro factum habitat in sacrse Virginis membra. In cujus adventu omnis de cap- tivitate redimitur terra ; quae detinebatur per transgres- sionem Adse in obscurata gehenna. Nunc moveatur mare, et omnia quae in eo sunt ; montes exsultent et omnia ligna silvarum ; quia Deus homo dignatur, per ute- rum beatae Virginis Marise, de ccelo in mundum venire. Per ipsius igitur adventum te deprecamur, omnipotens Deus, ut nostrse carnis fra- gilitatem a vinculis peccato- rum absolvas, et prsesenti f amiliae tuse misericordia ple- nus occurras.

The earth is glad, 0 Lord, and leaps with joy, for that the Word made flesh dwells in the womb of the Holy Virgin. At his Coming, the whole earth is ransomed from captivity, after having been kept, by Adam's sin, in a dark prison. Now let the sea be moved, and all things that are therein ; let the mountains leap with joy, and all the trees of the forests ; because God, having become man, has deigned to come, through the womb of the Blessed Virgin Mary, from heaven into this world. By this his Coming, therefore we beseech thee, O Almighty God, that thou loose the weakness of our flesh from the bonds of sin, and come, in thy overflowing mercy, to the assistance of this thy family here present before thee.

OF THE SECOND WEEK OF ADVENT.

Regem venturum Domi- num, venite, adoremus.

De Isaia Propheta. Cap. XIX. Onus iEgypti. Ecce Do- minus ascendet super nubem levem : et ingredietur iEgyp- tum : et commovebuntur simulacra iEgypti a facie ejus, et cor iEgypti tabescet in medio ejus : et concurrere faciam iEgyptios adversus iEgyptios, et pugnabit vir contra fratrem suum, et vir contra amicum suum, civitas adversus civitatem, regnum adversus regnum.

Come, let us adore the King our Lord, who is to come.

From the Prophet Isaias. Ch. XIX.

The burden of Egypt. Be- hold the Lord will ascend upon a light cloud : and will enter into Egypt : and the idols of Egypt shall be moved at his presence, and the heart of Egypt shall melt in the midst thereof : and I will set the Egyptians to fight against the Egyptians, and they shall fight brother against brother, and friend against friend, city against city, kingdom against king- dom.

The Egypt, which the Lord is here represented as visiting, and whose idols and empire he will overthrow, is the City of Satan, which is to be destroyed, and give place to the City of God. But how peaceful is the divine Conqueror's entrance into his conquest ! it is on a cloud, a light cloud, that he comes, as on his triumphal chariot. How many mysteries in these few words ! " There are three Clouds," says Peter of Blois ; " the first, the obscurity of the Prophets ; the " second, the depth of the divine Decrees ; the third, " the prodigy of a Virgin Mother."1 First, as to the obscurity of the Prophets, it is essential to every

Prophecy that it be thus veiled, to the end that man's free will may not be interfered with ; but under this cloud the Lord comes at last, and when the day comes for the Prophecy to be accomplished, all things are clear enough. Thus was it with the first Coming ; so will it be with the second. Then, as to the Decrees of God ; as they are ordinarily made manifest by second, that is, by created, causes only, — it almost always happens, that the extreme simplicity of the means employed by the divine Wisdom takes men by surprise. Never was this so observable as in the grand event of the Incarnation. Men would naturally expect that, in restoring a fallen world, a power, equal, at least, to that which first created it, would be displayed ; and all they are told about the portent is : You will find the Child wrapped in swaddling clothes, and laid in a manger I O almighty power of God, how dazzling is thy light through this Cloud ! how strong art thou in this apparent weakness !

But there is the third Cloud; it is the Virgin Mary ; a light cloud, " for," says St. Jerome, " neither " concupiscence, nor the burden of earthly marriage, " weigh upon her ;" a Cloud, too, laden with a re- freshing Dew, since it holds the Just One, who is to be rained down upon us, that our seething passions may be quenched, and the soil of our spiritual life made fertile. How sweet is the majesty of our divine King, when seen thus through this beautiful Cloud ! O incomparable Virgin ! the whole Church of God recognises thee in that mysterious Cloud, which the Prophet Elias,1 from the summit of Mount Carmel, saw rising up from the sea, little, at first, like a man's foot, but sending at last such a plentiful rain that all Israel was refreshed by its abundance. Delay not, we pray thee ; give us that heavenly and divine Dew which thou possessest within thee ; our 1 III. Kings, xviii. 42, 43.

sins have made the heavens as brass, and we are parched ; thou alone of creatures art just and pure ! Beseech our Lord, who has set up his Throne of mercy in thee, to come speedily and destroy our enemies and bring us peace.

HYMN FOE ADVENT.

{The Mozarabic Breviary, First Sunday of Advent)

The almighty King of the universe, coming to save the world, assumed to himself a body like unto ours.

He who reigns with the Most High, enters the Vir- gin's womb, that he may be born in the flesh, and break the bonds of death.

The nations have sat in darkness ; but they shall see the brightest light, when the Saviour shall come to re- deem his creatures.

He, of whom the future- seeing oracles of the Prophets anciently sang, shall now come in glory to cure our wounds.

Let us now be glad in the Lord, and in the Son of God, and be ready to receive him in his glorious coming. Amen.

Cunctorum rex omnipo- tens, Mundum salvare veniens, Formam assumpsit corporis Nostras similitudinis.

Qui regnat cum Altissimo, Virginis intrat uterum, Nasciturus in corpore, Mortis vincla disrumpere.

Blessed Virgin Mary ; from whose womb grew the Fruit, which has filled us with the Bread of Angels. That Fruit which Eve took from us when she sinned, Mary has restored to us, and it has saved %s. Not as the work of the Ser- pent is the work of Mary. From the one, came the poi- son of our destruction ; from the other, the mysteries of Salvation. In the one, we see the malice of the temp- ter ; in the other, the help of the divine Majesty. By the one, came death to the crea- ture ; by the other, the re- surrection of the Creator, by whom human nature, now not captive but free, is restored ; and what it lost by its parent Adam, it regained by its Maker Christ.

FRIDAY

OF THE SECOND WEEK OF ADVENT.

Come, let us adore the King our Lord, who is to come.

From the Prophet Isaias.

Ch. XXIV.

Behold the Lord shall lay waste the earth, and shall strip it : and shall afflict the face thereof, and scatter abroad the inhabitants there- of. And it shall be as with the people, so with the priest ; and as with the servant, so with his master ; as with the handmaid, so with her mis- tres ; as with the buyer, so with the seller ; as with the lender, so with the borrower ; as with him that calleth for his money, so with him that oweth. With desolation shall the earth be laid waste, and it shall be utterly spoiled : for the Lord hath spoken this word. The earth mourned, and faded away, and is weak- ened : the world faded away, the height of the people of the earth is weakened. And the earth is infected by the inhabitants thereof : because they have transgressed the laws, they have changed the ordinance, they have broken the everlasting covenant.

De Isaia Propheta.

Cap. XXIV.

Ecce Dominus Dissipabit terram, et nudabit earn ; et affliget faciem ejus et dis- perget habitatores ejus. Et erit sicut populus, sic sa- cerdos ; et sicut servus, sic dominus ejus ; sicut ancilla, sic domina ejus ; sicut emens, sic ille qui vendit ; sicut fcenerator, sic is qui mu- tuum accipit- sicut qui re- petit, sic qui debet. Dissi- patione dissipabitur terra, et direptione prsedabitur : Dominus enim locutus est verbum hoc. Luxit, et de- nuxit terra, et infirmata est : defluxit orbis, infirmata est altitudo populi terras. Et terra infecta est ab habita- toribus suis : quia transgressi sunt leges, mutaverunt jus, dissipaverunt foedus sempi- ternum. Propter hoc male- dictio vorabit terram, et pec- cabunt habitatores ejus, ideoque insanient cultores ejus : et relinquentur ho- mines pauci. Luxit _ yinde- mia, infirmata est vitis, in-

ADVENT.

Therefore shall a curse de- vour the earth and the inha- bitants thereof shall sin, and therefore they that dwell therein shall be mad, and few men shall be left. The vin- tage hath mourned, the vine hath languished away, all the merry hearted have sighed. The mirth of timbrels hath ceased, the noise of them that rejoice is ended, the melody of the harp is silent. They shall not drink wine with a psalm • the drink shall be bitter to them that drink it. The city of vanity is broken down, every house is shut up, no man cometh in. There shall be a crying for wine in the streets : all mirth is for- saken, the joy of the earth is gone away. Desolation is felt in the city, and calamity shall oppress the gates. For it shall be thus in the midst of the earth, in the midst of the people, as if a few olives that remain should be shaken out of the olive tree : or grapes, when the vintage is ended. These shall lift up their voice, and shall give praise, when the Lord shall be glorified, they shall make a joyful noise from the sea. Therefore glorify ye the Lord in instruction : the name of the Lord God of Israel in the islands of the sea. From the ends of the earth we have heard praises, the glory of the just one.

Thus was the earth in desolation when the Messias came to deliver and save it. So diminished, so de- cayed, were truths among the children of men,1 that 1 Ps. xi. 2.

gemuerunt omnes qui lseta- bantur corde. Cessavit gau- dium tympanorum, quievit sonitus lsetantium, conticuit dulcedo citharae. Cum can- tico nonbibent vinum : amara erit potio bibentibus illam. Attrita est civitas vanitatis : clausa est omnis domus, nullo introeunte. Clamor erit super vino in plateis : deserta est omnis lsetitia, translatum est gaudium terrse. Relicta est in urbe solitudo, et calamitas opprimet portas. Quia haec erunt in medio terrse, in medio populorum ; quomodo si pauese olivae quae remanse- runt, excutiantur ex olea : et racemi, cum fuerit finita vindemia. Hilevabuntvocem suam, atque laudabunt ; cum glorificatus fuerit Dominus, hinnient de mari. Propter hoc in doctrinis glorificate Dominum, in insulis maris nomen Domini Dei Israel.

the human race was bordering on its ruin. The knowledge of the true God was becoming rarer as the world got older ; idolatry had made everything in creation an object of its adulterous worship ; the practical result of a religion which was but gross materialism, was frightful immorality ; man was for ever at war with man; and the only safeguards of what social order still existed in the world, were the execrable laws of slavery and extermination. Among the countless inhabitants of the globe, a mere hand- ful could be found who were seeking God ; they were as rare as the olives that remain on the tree after a careful plucking, or as grape-bunches after the vin- tage is ended. Of this happy few were, among the Jewish people, those true Israelites whom our Saviour chose for his disciples ; and, among the Gentiles, the Magi that came from the East, asking for the new-born King; and later on, Cornelius the Centurion, whom the Angel of the Lord directed to St. Peter. But, with what faith and joy did they not acknow- ledge the Incarnate God ! and what their hymns of glad gratitude, when they found that they had been privileged, above others, to see, with their own eyes, the promised Saviour !

Now, all this will again happen when the time draws near of the second Coming of the Messias. The earth will once more be filled with desolation, and mankind will be again a slave of its self-de^rada- tion. The ways of men will again grow corrupt ; and, this time, the malice of their evil will be the greater, because they will have received Him who is the Light of the world, the Word of Life. A profound sadness will sit heavy on all nations, and every effort for their well-being will seem paralysed ; they, and the earth they live on, will be conscious of decrepitude ; and yet it will never once strike them that the world is drawing to an end. There will be great scandals ; there shall fall stars from heaven, that is, many of

200 ADVENT.

those who had been masters in Israel shall apostatise, and their light shall be changed into darkness. There shall be days of temptation, and faith shall grow slack ; so that when the Son of Man shall ap- pear, faith shall scarce be found on the earth. Let it not be, O Lord, that we live to see those days of temptation ; or, if it be thy will that they overtake us, make our hearts firm in their allegiance to thy holy Church, -which will be the only beacon left to thy faithful children in that fierce storm. Grant, O Lord, that we may be of the number of those chosen olives, of those elect bunches of grapes, wherewith thou wilt complete the rich harvest which thou wilt garner for ever into thy house. Preserve intact within us the deposit of faith which thou hast in- trusted to us ; let our eye be fixed on that Orient of ■ which the Church speaks to us, and where thou art suddenly to appear in thy majesty. When that day of thine comes, and we behold thy triumph, we will shout our glad delight, and then, like eagles which cluster round the body, we shall be taken up to meet thee in the air, as thy Apostle speaks, and thus shall we for ever be with thee.1 Then we shall hear the praises and glory of the Just One, from the ends of this earth, which it is thy good will to preserve until the decrees of thy mercy and justice shall have been fully executed. 0 Jesus ! we are the work of thy hands; save us, and be merciful to us on that great day.

Quia posuisti civitatem in tumu- lum, urbem f ortem in ruinam, domum alienorum, ut non sit civitas, et in sempiternum non gedificetur. Super hoc laudabit te populus fortis, civitas gentium robustarum timebit te. Quia factus es fortitudo pauperi, fortitudo egeno in tribulatione sua : spes a turbine, umbraculum ab sestu. Et faciet Dominus exercituum omnibus populis in monte hoc convivium pin- guium, convivium vindemise, pinguium medullatorum, vin- denrise defaecatse.

Come, let us adore the King our Lord, who is to come.

From the Prophet Isaias. Ch. XXV.

O Lord, thou art my God, I will exalt thee, and give glory to thy name : for thou hast done wonderful things, thy designs of old faithful. Amen. For thou hast re- duced the city to a heap, the strong city to ruin, the house of strangers to be no city, and to be no more built up for ever. Therefore shall a strong people praise thee, the city of mighty nations shall fear thee. . . Because thou hast been a strength to the poor, a strength to the needy in his distress : a refuge from the whirlwind, a shadow from the heat. And the Lord of hosts shall make unto all people, in this mountain, a feast of fat things, a feast of wine, of fat things full of marrow, of wine purified from the lees. And he shall destroy in this mountain the face of the bond with which all people are tied, and the web that he began over all nations. He shall cast death down headlong for ever : and

Lo, this is our God, we have waited for him, and he will save us : this is the Lord, we have patiently waited for him, and we shall rejoice and be joyful in his salvation.

Yet a little while, and the conqueror of death will appear, and then, in the joy of our hearts, we will say : Lo, this is our God ; we have waited for him, and he will save us ; we have patiently tvaitedfor him ; this is he, and we will rejoice and be joyful in his salvation. Let us, therefore, prepare the way of the Lord, that we may receive him worthily ; and in this work of our preparation, let us have recourse to Mary. Saturday is the day which is sacred to her ; she will the more readily grant the prayers said to her upon it. Let us consider her in her grand privilege of being full of grace, carrying in her womb Him whom we so long to possess. If we ask her, by what means she rendered herself worthy of such an immense favour, she will tell us that in her was simply fulfilled the prophecy, which the Church so continually repeats during these days of Advent : Every valley shall be filled up. The humble Mary was the valley blessed of the Lord ; a valley beautiful and fertile, in which God sowed the Divine Wheat, our Saviour, Jesus : for it is written in the Psalm, that the Valleys shall abound with corn} O Mary ! it was thy humility that drew down upon thee the admiration of thy Creator. If, from the high heaven where he dwells, he had

perceived a Virgin more humble in her love, he would have chosen her in preference to thee : but no, it was thou that didst win his predilection, O mystic valley, ever verdant and lovely in thy flowers of grace. We that, like high hills, are so proud and such sinners, what shall we do ? We must look on this God of ours, who comes to us in infinite humi- lity, and then humble ourselves out of love and gratitude. O Blessed Mother ! obtain this grace for us. Pray for us, that henceforth we may submit ourselves to the will of our Lord as thou didst, when thou didst speak those admirable words : Behold the handmaid of the Lord : may it be done to me according to thy word !

A dry branch, with not one drop of dew, once yielded a flower and fruit ; it was a new law, a new way : so was it when the Virgin brought forth her Son.

May he, that for our sakes was thus born, wipe away all our gilt; for our sojourn here is full of dangers.

Amen.

Ne appropiet indigne Calciatus quisquam.

Virga sicca sine rore, Novo ritu novo more, Fructum protulit cum flore ; Sicque Virgo peperit.

Benedictus talis fructus, Fructus gaudii, non luctus ; Non erit Adam seductus, Si de hoc gustaverit.

Jesus noster, Jesus bonus, Piae Matris pium onus, Cujus est in ccelo thronus Nascitur in stabulo.

Qui sic est pro nobis natus Nostros deleat reatus ; Quia noster incolatus Hie est in periculo.

Amen.

PRAYER FROM THE MOZARABIC BREVIARY. {For the Friday of the third Week of Advent)

Who, O God thou Son of God, who can search into thy ways? and tell how thou wast born of a Virgin, when thou earnest from heaven, or by what paths thou didst return thither "? And therefore since thou alone knowestall things, thou whose name is beyond the ends of the earth ; grant us so to think and speak of thee, as to be guiltless of error : that so thou, who, high in power, dost come down to lowly things and love them, mayest make us worthy of thy gifts. Amen.

Quis poterit, Deus Dei Filius, scrutari vias tuas1? Vel quibus aditibus nasci- turus ad Virginem veneris? Vel quibus semitis ad su- perna regressus es 1 Et ideo, quia tu solus cuncta consi- derans es, cujus nomen supra terrae terminos permanet ; da nobis, ilia de te semper con- siderare et dicere, quae culpaB careant lege : ut, qui excel- sus in fortitudine veniens hu- milia respicis, dignos facias nos muneribus tuis. Amen.

206 ADVENT.

THE THIRD SUNDAY OF ADVENT.

To-DAY, again, the Church is full of joy, and the joy is greater than it was. It is true that her Lord is not come; but she feels that he is nearer than before, and therefore she thinks it just to lessen somewhat the austerity of this penitential season by the innocent cheerfulness of her sacred rites. And first, this Sunday has had the name of Gaudete given to it, from the first word of the Introit; it also is honoured with those impressive exceptions which belong to the fourth Sunday of Lent, called Lcetare. The Organ is played at the Mass ; the Vestments are Rose-colour ; the Deacon resumes the dalmatic, and the Sub-Deacon the tunic; and in Cathedral Churches, the Bishop assists with the precious mitre. How touching are all these usages, and how admirable this condescension of the Church, wherewith she so beau- tifully blends together the unalterable strictness of the dogmas of faith and the graceful poetry of the formulae of her liturgy ! Let us enter into her spirit, and be glad on this third Sunday of her Advent, because our Lord is now so near unto us. To-morrow we will resume our attitude of servants mourning for the absence of their Lord and waiting for him ; for every delay, however short, is painful and makes love sad.

The Station is kept in the Basilica of St. Peter, at the Vatican. This august temple, which contains the tomb of the Prince of the Apostles, is the home and refuge of all the faithful of the world ; it is but natural that it should be chosen to be witness both of the joy and the sadness of the Church.

THIRD SUNDAY OF ADVENT.

207

The Night Office commences with a new Invitatory. The voice of the Church no longer invites the faith- ful to come and adore in fear and trembling the King, our Lord, who is to come. Her language assumes another character ; her tone is one of gladness ; and now, every day, until the Vigil of Christmas, she begins her Nocturns with these grand words :

The Lord is now- come, let us adore.

nigh ; Prope est jam Dominus : venite, adoremus.

Now let us take the book of the Prophet, and read with the Church :

From the Prophet Isaias.

Ch. XXVI.

In that day shall this can- ticle be sung in the land of Juda. Sion the City of our strength ; a Saviour, a wall, and a bulwark shall be set therein. Open ye the gates and let the just nation, that keepeth the truth, enter in. The old error is passed away, thou wilt keep peace : peace, because we have hoped in thee. You have hoped in the Lord for evermore : in the Lord God mighty for ever. For he shall bring down them that dwell on high, the high city he shall lay low. He shall bring it down even to the ground, he shall pull it down even to the dust. The foot shall tread it down ; the feet of the poor, the steps of the needy. The way of the just is right, the path of the just is right to walk in. And in the way of thy judgments, O Lord, we have patiently

hath desired thee in the night : yea, and with my spirit within me in the morning early I will watch to thee.

O Holy Roman Church, City of our Strength! behold us thy children assembled within thy walls, around the tomb of the Fisherman, the Prince of the Apostles, whose sacred relics protect thee from their earthly shrine, and whose unchanging teaching en- lightens thee from heaven. Yet, 0 City of strength ! it is by the Saviour, who is coming, that thou art strong. He is thy wall, for it is he that encircles, with his tender mercy, all thy children; he is thy bulwark, for it is by him that thou art invincible, and that all the powers of hell are powerless to prevail against thee. Open wide thy gates, that all nations may enter thee ; for thou art mistress of holiness and the guardian of truth. May the old error, which sets itself against the faith, soon disappear, and peace reign over the whole fold ! O Holy Roman Church ! thou hast for ever put thy trust in the Lord ; and he, faithful to his promise, has humbled before thee the haughty ones that defied thee, and the proud cities that were against thee. Where now are the Caesars, who boasted that they had drowned thee in thine own blood? where the Emperors, who would ravish the in- violate virginity of thy faith ? where the Heretics, who, during the past centuries of thine existence, have assailed every article of thy teaching, and denied what they listed ? where the ungrateful Princes, who would fain make a slave of thee, who had made them what they were ? where that Empire of Mahomet, which has so many times raged against thee, for that thou, the defenceless State, didst arrest the pride of its con- quests? where the Reformers, who were bent on giving

the world a Christianity, in which thou wast to have no part ? where the more modern Sophists, in whose philosophy thou wast set down as a system that had been tried, and was a failure, and is now a ruin ? and those Kings who are acting the tyrant over thee, and those people that will have liberty independently and at the risk of truth, where will they be in another hundred years ? Gone and forgotten as the noisy anger of a torrent ; whilst thou, 0 holy Church of Rome, built on the immovable rock, wilt be as calm, as young, as unwrinkled as ever. Thy path through all the ages of this world's duration, will be right as that of the j list man ; thou wilt ever be the self- same unchanging Church, as thou hast been during the eighteen hundred years past, whilst everything else under the sun has been but change. Whence this thy stability, but from Him who is very Truth and Justice ? Glory be to him in thee ! Each year, he visits thee; each year, he brings thee new gifts, wherewith thou mayest go happily through thy pilgrimage; and to the end of time, he will visit thee, and renew thee, not only with the power of that look wherewith Peter was renewed, but by filling thee with himse]f, as he did the ever glorious Virgin, who is the object of thy most tender love, after that which thou bearest to Jesus himself. We pray with thee, O Church, our Mother 1 and here is our prayer : Come, Lord Jesus ! " Thy name and thy "remembrance are the desire of our souls: they have " desired thee in the night, yea, and early in the " morning have they watched for thee."

MASS.

The assembly of the faithful is attentive; the chanters intone the Gregorian melody, and the church echoes with these sweet words :

P

INTROIT.

Gaudete in Domino sem- per : iterum dico, gaudete. Modestia vestra nota sit om- nibus hominibus : Dominus enim prope est. Nihil sol- liciti sitis : sed in omni ora- tione petitiones vestrae inno- tescant apud Deum.

Ps. Benedixisti Domine terram tuam : avertisti cap- tivitatem Jacob, ff. Gloria Patri.

Rejoice in the Lord always : again I say, re- joice. Let your modesty be known to all men : for the Lord is nigh. Be nothing solicitous : but in every prayer let your petitions be made known to God.

Ps. O Lord, thou hast blessed thy land : thou hast turned away the captivity of Jacob, y. Glory.

In the Collect, the Church asks for the grace of that divine visit, which dispels darkness and brings light. Darkness produces fear in the soul ; whereas, light gives courage and joy to the heart.

COLLECT.

Aurem tuam, qnassumus, Domine, precibus nostris ac- commoda : et mentis nostrae tenebras gratia tuas _ visita- tionis illustra. Qui vivis.

Bend thine ear, O Lord, we beseech thee, to our prayers ; and enlighten the darkness of our minds by the grace of thy visitation. Who livest, &c.

Nihil solicitous : but in everything, solliciti sitis : sed in omni by prayer and supplication oratione, et obsecration e, with thanksgiving, let your cum gratiarum actione, peti- petitions be made known to tiones vestrse innotescant God. And the peace of God, apud Deum. Et pax Dei, which surpasseth all under- quae exsuperat omnem sen- standing, keep your hearts sum, custodiat corda vestra, and minds in Christ Jesus et intelligentias vestras, in our Lord. Christo Jesu Domino nostro.

Nothing is more just than that we rejoice in the Lord. Both the Prophet and the Apostle excite us to desire the Saviour: both of them promise us Peace. Therefore, let us not be solicitous : The Lord is nigh ; nigh to his Church, and nigh to each of our souls. Who can be near so burning a fire, and yet be cold ? Do we not feel that he is coming to us, in spite of all obstacles ? He will let nothing be a barrier between himself and us, neither his own infinite high majesty, nor our exceeding lowliness, nor our many sins. Yet a little while, and he will be with us. Let us go out to meet him by these prayers, and supplications, and thanksgiving which the Apostle recommends to us. Let our zeal to unite ourselves with our holy mother the Church become more than ever fervent : now every day her prayers will increase in intense earnestness, and her longings after Him, who is her light and her love, will grow more ardent. First let us say together with her:

In illo tempore : Miserunt Judsei ab Jerosolymis sacer- dotes et levitas ad Joannem ut interrogarent eum : Tu quis es ? Et conf essus est, et non negavit, et confessus est : Quia non sum ego Christus. Et interrogaverunt eum : Quid ergo 1 Elias es tu1? Et dixit : Non sum. Propheta es tu 1 Et respondit : Non. Dixerunt ergo ei : Quis es, ut responsum demus his qui miserunt nos 1 Quid dicis de teipso 1 Ait : Ego vox elamantis in deserto : Diri- gite viam Domini, sicut dixit Isaias propheta. Et qui missi fuerant erant ex Pharisaeis. Et interrogave- runt eum, et dixerunt ei : Quid ergo baptizas, si tu nones Christus, neque Elias, i j eque propheta ? Respondit eis Joannes, clicens : Ego baptizo in aqua : medius autem vestrum stetit, quern vos nescitis. Ipse est, qui post me venturus est, qui ante me f actus est : cujus ego non sum dignus ut solvam ejus corrigiam^ calceamenti. lisec in Bethania facta sunt trans Jordanem, ubi erat Joannes baptizans.

Sequel of the holy Gospel according to John.

Ck I.

At that time : the Jews sent from Jerusalem priests and levites to John, to ask him : Who art thou 1 And he confessed, and did not deny, and he confessed : I am not the Christ. And they asked him : What then 1 Art thou Elias ] And he said : I am not. Art thou a prophet] And he answered : No. They said therefore unto him : Who art thou, that we may give an answer to them that sent us 1 What sayest thou of thyself 1 He said : I am the voice of one crying in the wilderness : Make straight the way of the Lord, as said the Prophet Isaias. And they that were sent were of the Pharisees. And they asked him, and said to him : Why then dost thou baptise, if thou be not Christ, nor Elias, nor a prophet] John an- swered them saying : I bap- tise with water ; but there hath stood one in the midst of you, whom you know not. The same is he that shall come after me, who is pre- ferred before me : the latchet of whose shoe I am not worthy to loose. These things were done in Bethania, be- yond the Jordan, where John was baptising.

THIRD SUNDAY OF ADVENT. 213

There hath stood One in the midst of you, whom you know not, says St. John the Baptist to them that were sent by the Jews. So that, our Lord may be near, he may even have come, and yet by some be not known ! This Lamb of God is the holy Precur- sor's consolation : he considers it a singular privilege to be but the Voice, which cries out to men to pre- pare the way of the Redeemer. Id this, St. John is the type of the Church, and of all such as seek Jesus. St. John is full of joy because the Saviour is come : but the men around him are as indifferent as though they neither expected nor wanted a Saviour. This is the third week of Advent ; and are all hearts excited by the great tidings told them by the Church, that the Messias is near at hand ? They who love him not as their Saviour, do they fear him as their Judge ? Are the crooked ways being made straight? are the hills being brought low ? are Christians seriously engaged in removing from their hearts the love of riches and the love of sensual pleasures ? There is no time to lose : the Lord is nigh ! If these lines should come under the eye of any of those Christians, who are in this state of sinful indif- ference, we would conjure them to shake off their lethargy, and render themselves worthy of the visit of the divine Infant : such a visit will bring them the greatest consolation here, and give them confi- dence hereafter, when our Lord will come to judge all mankind. Send thy grace, O Jesus, still more plentifully into their hearts ; compel them to go in, and permit not that it be said of the children of the Church, as St. John said of the Synagogue : There standeth in the midst of you One, whom ye know not

During the Offertory, the faithful should unite in the prayer of the Church, and beg that the captivity, in which our sins hold us, may be brought to an end, and that the divine Deliverer may come.

OF THE THIRD WEEK OF ADVENT.

The Lord is now nigh ; Prope est jam Dominus : come, let us adore. venite, adoremus.

From the Prophet Isaias.

Ch. XXVIII.

/■* Thus saith the Lord God : Behold, I will lay a stone in the foundations ©f Sion, a tried stone, a corner stone, a precious stone, founded in the foundation. He that be- lieveth, let him not hasten. And I will set judgment in weight, and justice in mea- sure : and hail shall overturn the hope of falsehood, and waters shall overflow its pro- tection. And your league with death shall be abolished, and your covenant with hell shall not stand.

Heavenly Father! thou art preparing to set in the foundations of Sion a corner Stone, that is tried and solid ; and this Stone, which is to give firmness to Sion, which is thy Church, this Stone is thy In- carnate Son. It was prefigured, as thy Apostle assures us,1 by that Rock of the desert, which yielded the abundant and saving stream, that quenched the thirst of thy people. But now thou art about to give us the reality; it has already come down from heaven, and the hour is fast approaching when thou wilt lay it in the foundations. O sacred Stone, 1 1. Cor. x. 4.

Et delebitur foedus vestrum cum morte, et pac- tum vestrum cum inferno non stabit.

which makest all one, and givest solidity to the whole structure ! By thee it will come to pass, that there shall be no longer Jew nor Gentile, but all nations shall become one family. Men shall no more build on sand, nor set up houses which floods and storms may overturn. The Church shall rise up from the Stone which God now sets, and, secure on the great foundation, her summit shall touch the clouds. With all his weakness, and all his fickleness, man will partake of thy immutability, O divine Stone, if he will but lean on thee. Wo to him that rejects thee, for thou hast said, and thou art the eternal Truth : Whosoever shall fall upon that Stone, shall be bruised ; and upon whomsoever it shall fall, it will grind him to powder} From this twofold evil, 0 thou that art chief Corner-stone, deliver us, and never permit us to be of the number of those blind men who rejected thee. Give us grace ever to honour and love thee as the cause of our strength, and the one sole origin of our solidity : and since thou hast communicated this thy quality of the Rock to one of thine Apostles, and by him to his successors unto the end of the world, grant us ever to cling to this Rock, the Holy Roman Church, in union with which all the faithful on the face of the earth are preparing to celebrate the glorious solem- nity of thy Coming, 0 precious and tried Stone ! Thou art coming that thou mayest destroy the king- dom of falsehood, and break the league which man- kind had made with death and hell.

THIRD MONDAY OF ADVENT.

219

When his only begotten Son, who created this world, redeemed ns, he fulfilled the promises which the divine Prophets spoke in the ages past.

The Word having come down from heaven, and shown himself to men, he took away the punishment due to their sins; and assuming our na- ture, though but dust, he vanquished the prince of death.

Born of a Mother in time, but begotten eternally from the Father, in the two sub- stances there is but one Per- son, that is the Person of the Word.

God has come into this world made Man, that our old man being changed into the new, we may put on new beauty by being regenerated in the new-born God.

Let the Gentiles, who have received this new birth of grace, in gladness and exul- tation at the trophy, won by the divine Nativity, keep every year its feast.

Let this Coming of Jesus be celebrated with devout solemnity by all, who have so just a share in the glory of this great day.

That so, when the second Coming shall burst upon the world and fill it with fear, this most humble expression of our devout celebration of the first may give us confi- dence.

To God the Father, and to his only Son, and to the Holy Spirit, be glory for ever and ever. Amen.

Vere dignum et justum est, aequum et salutare, nos beatss semper Virginis Marise solem- nia celebrare, quae parvo utero Dominum cceli portavit; et, Angelo praenuntiante, Ver- bum carne mortali edidit salvatorem.

It is truly meet and just, right and available to salva- tion, that in this holy time we should celebrate the memory of the ever Blessed Virgin Mary, who carried in the nar- row inclosure of her womb the Lord of heaven, and who, according as the Angel had foretold to her, brought forth the Word become our Saviour in our mortal flesh. This is he who is the Redeemer of the world, conceived in a chaste womb, his Mother both then and at his birth remain- ing ineffably the Virgin.

And the Lord will give you spare bread and short water : and will not cause thy teacher to flee away from thee any more, and thy eyes shall see thy teacher. And rain shall be given to thy seed, wheresoever thou shalt sow in the land : and the bread of the corn of the land shall be most plentiful and fat.

Behold the name of the Lord cometh from afar, his wrath burnetii, and is heavy to bear : his lips are filled with indignation, and his tongue as a devour- ing fire. His breath as a torrent overflowing even to the midst of the neck, to destroy the nations unto no- thing, and the bridle of error that was in the jaws of the people.

And are we then to weep no more, O Jesus ? Happy we ! How could we be sad now that thou hast heard our prayers, and our eyes shall behold thee, our Master, and our Teacher ? If thou yet delayest some days longer, it is only that we may have more time to re- ceive what thou hast made it thy glory to give, — the mercy and the pardon of our sins. O the happiness of thy kingdom ! O the richness of our lands, that is, of our souls, when thy dew shall have fallen upon them ! O the sweetness of our Bread, which is to be thyself, O Living Bread come down from heaven ! 0 the bright- ness of the light which thou wilt give us, even on the very day when thou wilt have bound up our wounds ! Blessed day, come quickly ! And thou, dear night, when Mary is to give her divine Babe to us, when

wilt thou come ? So great is our hope in this thy merciful Coming, that we listen with less dread to the awful words of thy Prophet, who, with a rapidity swift as thine own word, passes over the loDg ages between the two events, and speaks to us of the ap- proach of the terrible day, when thou wilt come sud- denly, in thy burning wrath, with thy lips filled with indignation, and thy tongue as a devouring fire. Our present feeling is hope, for we are looking forward to that Coming, in which thou art the beautiful Prince of peace and love, and we cannot but hope. When that last day comes, have mercy on us ! but on this day of thine amiable visit, permit us to say to thee the words of one of thy servants: "Yes, dear Jesus, come, " come to us ! but in swathing-bands, not with thy " hand raised to punish us : in humility, not in thy " greatness : in the crib, not in the clouds of heaven : " in the arms of thy Mother, not on the Throne of thy " Majesty: on the colt of the ass, not on the Cherubim : " to us, and not against us : to save, and not to judge : " to visit us in thy peace, not to condemn us in thy " anger. If thou comest unto us thus, O Jesus ! it is " not from thee, but to thee, that we will flee." (The Venerable Peter of Celles, 1st Sermon of Advent)

Christ comes willingly to minister to us ; the Creator puts on the creature's form ; he that is rich in the God- head, mercifully bestows on the needy Adam a new crea- tion and birth.

He has bowed down the heavens, and, taking up his abode in the Virgin, he comes in our flesh to be born in Bethlehem's cave, as it is written ; and he that gives life to children in the womb, is himself become a child : let us all go forth to meet him with our hearts full of ardour andjoy.

The all-wise Lord thus born, comes among his own to receive hospitality from his own creatures ; let us re- ceive him, that this divine Babe of the cave may make us the guests of the paradise of delights.

Now is the portal of the Divine Incarnation opened to all : be glad, ye heavens ; exult with joy, all ye An- gels ! let the earth and its inhabitants rejoice in spirit with the Shepherds and the Magi.

The Virgin, as a precious vase of alabaster, bears the divine perfume into the cave, there wisely and inef- fably to yield what she con- tains, that she may fill our souls with the delicious fra- grance.

Sing, O Tsaias ! show us the Word of God, predict the bush that is to be on fire, yet not consumed ; the Virgin Mary. Put on thy splendour, the rays reflected from the Deity, O Bethle- hem ! open thy gates, O Eden ! Set out on your journey, ye Magi, to see the Saviour laid in swaddling- clothes in a manger, Him whom your star, standing over the cave, pointed out to you the Lord and giver of life, the Saviour of our race.

Thou didst bestow on man the gift of an indulgent par- don ; that thence thy bound- less mercy should restore life, whence man by his sin had wrought death. It was this that the voice of the Prophets had often foretold ; it was this that the Angel Gabriel announced to Mary as then to be presently ac- complished. The Virgin believed, and in that same hour, there was conceived in her womb the long-sighed- for Word, ever faithful to his promises. There did her Child lay concealed, until the law, which fixed the time of birth, had been observed, though it was He, whose sovereign will granted all things to be born. The Virgin was seen to be a Mother ; it was the prodigy of there being in the same body an immense fruitful- ness and an angelic purity. Great was the help augured to the world by this mystery of a Virgin Mother, where- by the Mother of her own Creator nourished him in her womb, she whose purity was undimmed by the least shadow of a stain.

WEDNESDAY IN EMBER WEEK. 227

WEDNESDAY

TN EMBER WEEK.

The Lord is now nigh ; Prope est jam Dominus ; come, let us adore. venite, adoremus.

Today the Church begins the Fast of Quatuor Tempora, or, as we call it, of Ember days : it in- cludes also the Friday and Saturday of this same week. This observance is not peculiar to the Advent liturgy; it is one which has been fixed for each of the four seasons of the Ecclesiastical Year. We may consider it as one of those practices which the Church took from the Synagogue ; for the Prophet Zach- arias speaks of the fourth, fifth, seventh, and tenth months.1 Its introduction into the Christian Church would seem to have been made in the apostolic times; such, at least, is the opinion of St. Leo, of St. Isidore of Seville, of Rabanus Maurus, and of several other ancient Christian writers. It is remarkable, on the other hand, that the Orientals do not observe this fast.

From the first ages, the Quatuor Tempora were kept, in the Roman Church, at the same time of the year as at present. As to the expression, which is not unfrequently used in the early writers, of The Three Times and not The Four, we must remember, that in the spring, these Days always come in the first week of Lent, a period already consecrated to the most rigorous fasting and abstinence, and that con- sequently they could add nothing to the penitential exercises of that portion of the year.

The intentions, which the Church has in the fast of the Ember Days, are the same as those of the 1 Zach. viii. 19.

228 ADVENT.

Synagogue ; namely, to consecrate to God by penance the four Seasons of the year. The Ember Days of Advent are known, in ecclesiastical antiquity, by the name of the Fast of the tenth Month ; and St. Leo, in one of his Sermons on this Fast, and of which the Church has inserted a passage in the second Nocturn of the third Sunday of Advent, tells us that a special fast was fixed for this time of the year, because the fruits of the earth had then all been gathered in, and that it behoved Christians to testify their gratitude to God by a sacrifice of abstinence, thus rendering them- selves more worthy to approach to God, the more they were detached from the love of created things ; " for " Fasting," adds the holy Doctor, " has ever been the " nourishment of virtue. Abstinence is the source of " chaste thoughts, of wise resolutions, and of salutary " counsel. By voluntary mortifications, the flesh " dies to its concupiscences, and the spirit is renewed " in virtue. But since Fasting alone is not sufficient " whereby to secure the soul's salvation, let us add to " it works of mercy towards the poor. Let us make " that which we retrench from indulgence, serve unto " the exercise of virtue. Let the abstinence of him " that fasts, become the meal of the poor man."

Let us, the children of the Church, practise what is in our power of these admonitions ; and since the actual discipline of Advent is so very mild, let us be so much the more fervent in fulfilling the precept of the fast of the Ember Days. By these few exercises which are now required of us, let us keep up within ourselves the zeal of our forefathers for this holy sea- son of Advent. We must never forget, that although the interior preparation is what is absolutely essential for our profiting by the Coming of our Lord Jesus Christ, yet this preparation could scarcely be real, unless it manifested itself by the exterior practices of religion and penance.

The fast of the Ember Days has another object

WEDNESDAY IN EMBER WEEK. 229

besides that of consecrating the four seasons of the year to God by an act of penance ; it has also in view the Ordination of the Ministers of the Church, which takes place on the Saturday, and of which notice was formerly given to the people during the Mass of the Wednesday. In the Roman Church, the Ordination held in the month of December was, for a long time, the most solemn of all ; and it would appear, from the ancient Chronicles of the Popes, that, excepting very extraordinary cases, the tenth month was, for several ages, the only time for the conferring Holy Orders in Rome. The faithful should unite with the Church in this her intention, and offer to God their fasting and abstinence for the purpose of obtaining worthy Ministers of the Word and the Sacraments, and true Pastors of the people.

The Church does not read anything, in the Matins of to-day, from the Prophet Isaias : she merely reads a sentence from the Chapter of St. Luke, which gives our Lady's Annunciation, to which she subjoins a passage from St. Ambrose's Homily on that Gospel. The fact of this Gospel having been chosen for the Office and Mass of to-day, has made the Wednesday of the third week of Advent a very marked day in the calendar. In several ancient Ordinaries, used by many of the larger Churches, both Cathedral and Abbatial, we find it prescribed, that feasts falling on this Wednesday should be transferred : that the ferial prayers should not be said kneeling, on that day ; that the Gospel Missus est, that is, of the Annunciation, should be sung at Matins by the Celebrant, vested in a white cope, with cross, lights, and incense, the great bell tolling meanwhile; that in Abbeys, the Abbot should preach a homily to the Monks, as on solemn feasts. We are indebted to this custom for the four magnificent Sermons of St. Bernard on our Blessed Lady, and which are entitled: Super Missus est

230 ADVENT.

As the Mass of the Ember Days is seldom sung, excepting in Churches where the Canonical Office is said ; as also that we might not add unnecessarily to this volume, we have thought it advisable to omit the Masses of Ember Wednesday, Friday, and Satur- day of Advent. The Station for the Wednesday is at St. Mary Major, on account of the Gospel of the Annunciation, which, as we have just seen, has made this day be looked upon as a real Feast of the Blessed Virgin.

Having to speak, later on, of this Mystery, in the Proper of Saints, we will conclude this Wednesday with a Prose of the Middle Ages, in honour of our Blessed Lady's receiving the Angel's salutation, and with a prayer taken from one of the ancient Liturgies.

{Taken from the Missal of Cluny of 1523).

thee, thy virginity shall be left intact : the power of God shall maintain it.

To this the noble Virgin answering, said to the Angel : I am the lowly handmaid of the Omnipotent God.

Consenting to thy word, O heavenly messenger, bearer of so great a secret, and de- siring to see fulfilled what thou announcest, 1 am ready to obey the decree of God.

The Angel left her, and in that moment her virginal womb conceived the Word made flesh from hers.

This was his chosen enclo- sure for nine months : then he left it, and began the great combat, carrying the cross upon his shoulders, wherewith he struck the enemy who brought death into the world.

Oh ! dear Mother of Jesus, who didst bring peace to Angels and to men by giving birth to Christ,

Pray for us to this thy Son, that he be merciful to us, and forgive us our sins, and give us his assistance, whereby, after this exile, we may pos- sess the blessed joys of eternal life. Amen.

Quod castimonia Manebit in te pura, Dei potentia.

Ad haec Virgo nobilis Respondens in quit ei : Servula sum humilis Omnipotentis Dei.

Tibi ccelesti nuncio, Tanti secreti conscio, Consentiens, et cupiens

Videre Factum quod audio, Parata sum parere Dei consilio.

Qui circumdatus utero, Novem mensium numero, Hinc exiit et iniit

Christ as one of the highest of God's wonderful works. A heavenly messenger an- nounced that he would be born among men. A Virgin, dwelling on this earth, was saluted by the Angel, and heard the great mystery. The Holy Ghost produced it in the Virgin's womb, when he came to her. So that thus, Gabriel announcing, Mary believing, and the Spirit co- operating with the Word of God, confidence followed the angelical salutation, and the promise was fulfilled by the reality that the Virgin should find herself to be made a mother, by the power of the Most High overshadowing her. Behold, said the Angel, thou shalt conceive in thy womb, and bring forth a Son. How shall this be 1 answered Mary. But because she said it from faith, not from doubt, the Holy Ghost accomplished what the Angel promised. Virgin before the conception, and Virgin after the birth of her Son, she had received her God in her soul, before pos- sessing him in her womb. Virgin full of the grace of God, she was the first to re- ceive the salvation of the world, and therefore was chosen to be the true Mother of the Son of God.

Ch. XXXIII.

O Lord, have mercy on us : for we have waited for thee : be thou our arm in the morning, and our salvation in the time of trouble. At the voice of the Angel the people fled, and at the lifting up thyself the nations are scattered. And your spoils shall be gathered together as the locusts are gathered, as when the ditches are full of them. The Lord is magnified, for he hath dwelt on high : he hath filled Sion with judg- ment and justice. And there shall be faith in thy times, riches of salvation, wisdom and knowledge : the fear of the Lord is his treasure. The sinners in Sion are afraid : trembling hath seized upon the hypocrites.

Happy he whose eyes shall thus contemplate the new-born King in the sweet majesty of his love and his humility! He shall be so taken with this hisbeauty, that the earth, with all its magnificence, shall appear as nothing in his eyes. The only thing he will care to look upon, will be upon Him that shall be laid in a manger, and wrapped in swaddling clothes. But, that we may have this happiness of closely contem- plating the divine King who is coming to us, that we may merit to enter his court, we must do as the Prophet bids us: we must walk injustice, and speak truth. Let us listen to the pious Rabanus Maurus, who expresses this, with much unction, in his first Sermon on Preparation for the feast of Christmas : " If at all times it behoves us to be adorned with the " comeliness of good works, we should be so, with an " especial care, on the Day of our Saviour's Birth. " Consider within yourselves, my Brethren, what " you would do, were a king, or prince, to invite you " to come to celebrate his Birth-day. Your garments " would be as new, as elegant, even as magnificent, "as you could procure them, for you would think it "an insult to him who invited you, were you to ap- " pear before him with anything upon you that was "torn, or poor, or unclean. Show a like solicitude " on the occasion of the coming Feast; — and let your "souls, beautified with the several ornaments of " virtue, go forth to their King. He loves the pearls " of simplicity, and the flowers of chaste sobriety :

THIRD THURSDAY OF ADVENT. 235

" wear them therefore. Let your consciences be " composed in a holy calm, now that the solemn feast " of Jesus' Nativity is so close upon us. Assist at it "lovely in your chastity, gorgeous in your charity, "beauteous by your almsdeeds, brilliant with justice "and humility, and, above all, radiant in the love of " God. If the Lord Jesus shall see you thus when "you keep his feast, believe me, he will do more than " visit your souls ; he will treat you with such fami- " liarity, that he will choose them for his favourite " abode, and there he will dwell forever, as it is written: " Behold ! I will come, and I will dwell with them ; " and they shall be my people, and I will be their " God." Christians, you have no time to lose : quickly prepare yourselves for this great visit. Let sinners be converted and become just: let the just become more just ; let the holy become more holy, for he that is coming is the Lord our God, and none else.

Grant, we beseech thee, that he, who redeemed us from the dark prison of hell, may lead us to the rewards which, are eternal ; and justify us in his second Coming, who redeemed us in the first : that thus, he, whose humility ex- alted us unto life, may by his most high majesty shield us from all evil.

IN EMBER WEEK.

The Lord is now nigh : Prope est jam Dominus ; come, let us adore. venite, adoremus.

The Church does not read anything from the Prophet Isaias to-day ; she merely gives, in the Office of Matins, a sentence of that chapter of St. Luke's Gospel, which relates the mystery of our Lady's Visitation : and to this she subjoins a frag- ment of St. Ambrose's Homily upon that passage. The considerations and affections with which this important event of our Lady's life ought to inspire the faithful, shall be given further on, in the Proper of the Saints.

The Station for to-day is in the Church of the Holy Apostles, which many suppose to have been first built by Constantine, and in which the glorious bodies of the two holy Apostles Philip and James the Less, buried under the altar, await the second Coming of Him, who chose them as his co- operators in the work of the first, and who, on the last day, will give them to sit upon thrones near his own, judging the twelve Tribes of Israel.1

That we may the better conform to the intentions of our Holy Mother the Church, who offers to our contemplation the Visitation of the Blessed Virgin, let us recite the following Hymn, composed in honour of this Mystery, during the ages of faith :

PRAYER FROM THE GALLICAN SACRAMENTARY. (In Adventu Domini, Collect.)

O Lord God, Father Al- mighty, purify the recesses of our heart, and mercifully wash away all the stains of our sins ; and grant, O Lord, that cleansed from our sins by thy merciful blessing, we may await in confidence the dread and terrible Coming of our Lord Jesus Christ.

Purifica, Domine Deus, Pater omnipotens, pectorum arcana nostrorum, cunctas- que propitius maculas ablue peccatorum : ac praesta, Do- mine, ut benedictione pietatis tuse a nostris criminibus mundati, metuendum terri- bilemque Adventum Domini nostri Jesu Christi exspecte- mus interriti.

240 ADVENT.

SATURDAY

IN EMBER WEEK.

Prope est jam Dominus; The Lord is now nigh; venite, adoremus. come, let us adore.

The Lessons from the Prophet Isaias are interrupted to-day also ; and a Homily on the Gospel of the Mass is read in their place. As this Gospel is re- peated in the Mass of the fourth Sunday of Advent, which is to-xnorrow, we will, for the present, omit it, and be satisfied with mentioning the reason of the same Gospel being assigned to the two days.

The primitive custom, in the Roman Church, was to hold Ordinations in the night between Saturday and Sunday, just as Baptism was administered to the Catechumens in the night between Holy Saturday and Easter Sunday. The ceremony took place to- wards midnight, and Sunday morning was always far advanced before the termination ; so that the Mass of Ordination was considered as the Mass of Sunday itself. Later on, discipline relaxed, and these severe vigils were given up ; the Ordination Mass, like that of Holy Saturday, was anticipated ; and, as the fourth Sunday of Advent and the second of Lent had not hitherto had a proper Gospel, since they had not had a proper Mass, it was settled about the tenth or eleventh century, that the Gospel of the Mass of Ordinations should be repeated in the special Mass of the two Sundays in question.

The Station is at St. Peter's, on account of the Ordinations. This Basilica was always one of the

largest of the City of Rome, and was therefore the best suited for the great concourse of people.

Let us honour Mary upon this day of the week, which is consecrated to her ; let us borrow a canticle from the Oriental Church, ever profuse in its praise of the Mother of God.

HYMN TAKEN FROM THE ANTHOLOGY OF THE

GREEKS.

{December 15.)

As a royal throne, thou carriest the Creator ; as a living couch, thou encirclest the King, O creature most dear to God !

Branch most vigorous, thou didst bud forth the Christ on whom we lean and are supported ; for Aaron's Branch, which, of old, bud- ded unplanted, was a type of thee, thou chaste dove, and ever a Virgin.

To sing the more than wonderful manner of thy ex- traordinary and incompre- hensible maternity, is above the power of all the choirs of men ; for no mind, no thought, no understanding, no . words, can reach the mystery.

Isaias seeing the unspeak- able miracle, the ineffable miracle of thy maternity, spoke thns divinely : The Holy Spirit hath come upon thee, O Mother of God ! pre- serving thee, as heretofore he kept entire the burning bush : and, therefore, we cry out with the Angel : Bejoice, O thou tabernacle of God !

Ut thronus purpuriformis Creatorem fers ; ut anima- tus thalamus regem circum- das, Deo gratissima.

Virga virtutis germinasti Christum in quo stabilimur ; te enim figurabat virga Aaron, olim germinans in- culta ; casta columba, sem- per virgo.

Hymnificare modum su- peradmirabilem, et omnem sensum superantem extra- ordinariae tuae graviditatis nesciunt omnium hominum catervae ; omnem enim men- tern et cogitationem praeter- greditur, ac intelligentias omnium et verborum virtu- tem.

Miraculum inenarrabile conceptionis atque imme- morandum gestationis tuae prodigium videns Isaias, divina voce clamabat : Spi- ritus Sanctus supervenit in te, Dei Mater ! rubum te servans ut olim incombus- tum ; et ideo cum Angelo clamamus : Gaude, Dei ta- bernaculum.

PRAYER FROM THE MOZARABIC MISSAL.

(Fifth Sunday of Advent, Illatio.)

Dignum et justum est nos tibi gratias agere, Domine sancte, Pater seterne, omni- potens Deus, per Jesum Christum Filium tuum Do- minum nostrum. Ejus in- carnatio salus facta est mundi, et passio exstitit re- demptio hominis procreati. Ipse igitur nos omnipotens Pater, quassumus^ perducat ad prsemium, qui redemit detenebrisinfernorum. Ipse carnem nostram a delietis emaculet, qui earn suscepit ex virgine. Ipse nos laesos tuae restituat majestati, qui nos tibi per sanguinem suum reconciliavit. Ipse nos se- cundi Adventus examina- tione justificet, qui in primo contulit donum gratias suae. Ipse ad judicandum veniat mitis, qui olim apparuit liumilis. Ipse in judicium ostendatur nobis mitissimus qui dudum venit occultus.

It is meet and just that we give thee thanks, 0 holy- Lord, Eternal Father, Al- mighty God, through Jesus Christ thy Son our Lord. His Incarnation was the sal- vation of the world, and his Passion the redemption of his creature, man. Therefore we beseech thee, O almighty Father, may He lead us to heaven, who purchased us from dark hell. May He cleanse our flesh from its sins, who took to himself that flesh from the Virgin. May He again bring us from our treason to fidelity, who reconciled us to thee by his Blood. May He make and find us just in the judg- ment of his second Coming, who conferred upon us the gift of his grace in the first. May He come to judge us in meekness, who heretofore came in humility to dwell with us. May He show him- self in gentlest meekness when He judges us, who heretofore hid himself in deepest humility when He redeemed us.

FOURTH SUNDAY OF ADVENT. 243

THE FOURTH SUNDAY OF ADVENT.

(If this Sunday fall on the 24stk of December, it is omitted that year ; and in its place is said the Office of Christmas Eve, which is given in the Proper of the Saints, December 24, "page 532.)

We have now entered into the week, which im- mediately precedes the Birth of the Messias. That long-desired Coming might be even to-morrow ; and at furthest, that is, when Advent is as long as it can be, the beautiful feast is only seven days from us. So that the Church now counts the hours ; she watches day and night, and since the 17th of Decem- ber, her Offices have assumed an unusual solemnity. At Lauds, she varies the Antiphons each day ; and at Vespers, in order to express the impatience of her desires for her Jesus, she makes use of the most vehement exclamations to the Messias, in which she each day gives him a magnificent title, borrowed from the language of the Prophets.

To-day,1 she makes a last effort to stir up the devotion of her children. She leads them to the desert ; she shows them John the Baptist, upon whose mission she instructed them on the third Sunday. The voice of the austere Precursor resounds through the wilderness, and penetrates even into the cities. It preaches penance, and the obligation men

are under of preparing, by self- purification, for the Coming of Christ. Let us retire from the world during these next few days ; or if that may not be by reason of our external duties, let us retire into the quiet of our own hearts and confess our iniquities, as did those true Israelites, who came, full of compunc- tion and of faith in the Messias, to the Baptist, there to make perfect their preparation for worthily receiv- ing the Redeemer, on the day of his appearing to the world.

See, then, with what redoubled earnestness the Church, before opening the book of her great Prophet, repeats her invitatory :

Prope est jam Dominus ; venite, adoremus.

De Isaia Propheta.

Cap. XXXV.

Lsetabitur deserta et in- via, et exsultabit solitudo, et florebit quasi lilium. Ger- minans germinabit, et exsul- tabit lsetabunda et laudans ; gloria Libani data est ei, decor Carmeli et Saron.

From the Prophet Isaias.

Ch. XXXV.

The land that was desolate and impassable shall be glad, and the wilderness shall re- joice, and shall nourish like the lily. It shall bud forth and blossom, and shall re- joice with joy and praise ; the glory of Libanus is given to it, the beauty of Carmel and Saron. They shall see the glory of the Lord, and the beauty of our God. Strengthen ye the feeble hands, and confirm the weak knees. Say to the faint- hearted : Take courage, and fear not. Behold your God will bring the revenge of re- compense : God himself will come and will save you. Then shall the eyes of the blind be opened, and the ears of the deaf shall be unstopped. Then shall the

And that which was dry land, shall be- come a pool, and the thirsty- land springs of water. In the dens where dragons dwelt before, shall rise up the ver- dure of the reed and the bul- rush. And a path and a way- shall be there, and it shall be called the holy way : the un- clean shall not pass over it ; and this shall be unto you a straight way, so that fools shall not err therein. No lion shall be there, nor shall any mischievous beast go up by it, nor be found there : but they shall walk there, that shall be delivered. And the redeemed of the Lord shall return, and shall come into Sion with praise, and ever- lasting joy shall be upon their heads : they shall ob- tain joy and gladness, and sorrow and mourning shall flee away.

O the joy of thy Coming, dear Jesus ! how great it must needs be, when the prophecy says it shall be like an everlasting crown upon our heads ! And could it be otherwise % The very desert is to flourish as a lily, and living waters are to gush forth out of the parched land, because their God is coming. Come, 0 Jesus, come quickly, and give us of that Water, which flows from thy Sacred Heart, and which the Samaritan woman, who is the type of us sinners, asked of thee with such earnest entreaty. This Water is thy Grace ; let it rain upon our parched souls, and they too will flourish ; let it quench our

thirst, and we will run in the way of thy precepts and examples. Thou, 0 Jesus, art our Way, our path, to God ; and thou art thyself God ; thou art, therefore, both our way and the term to which our way leads us. We had lost our way ; we had gone astray as lost sheep ; how great thy love to come thus in search of us ! To teach us the way to heaven, thou hast deigned to come down from heaven, and then tread with us the road which leads to it. No ! there shall be no more weak hands, nor feeble knees, nor faint hearts ; for we know that it is in love that thou art coming to us. There is but one thing which makes us sad :— our preparation is not complete. We have some ties still to break ; help us to do it, O Saviour of mankind ! We desire to obey the voice of thy Precursor, and make plain those rugged paths, which would prevent thy coming into our hearts, 0 divine Infant ! Give us to be baptised in the Baptism of the waters of penance ; thou wilt soon follow, baptising us in the Holy Ghost and love.

MASS.

The Prophet has made us thirst for that clear cool fountain, which he tells us is to spring up on the coming of the Messias ; let us ask, together with the Church, for the Dew which will give new life to our hearts, and for the Rain which will make them fruitful.

EPISTLE.

Lesson of the Epistle of Saint Paul the Apostle to the Corinthians.

Ch. IV Brethren, let a man so ac- count of us as of the minis- ters of Christ, and the dis- pensers of the mysteries of God. Here now it is re- quired amongst the dispen- sers that a man be found faithful. But to me it is a very small thing to be judged by you or by man's day : but neither do I judge my own self. For I am not conscious to myself of anything : yet

I am not hereby justified : but he that judges me is the Lord. Therefore judge not before the time till the Lord come : who both will bring to light the hidden things of darkness, and will make manifest the counsels of the heart : and then shall every man have praise from God.

The Church here reminds the people of the dignity of the Christian Priesthood. The occasion is an appropriate one, as the Ordinations were held yesterday. She also brings before her sacred Minis- ters the obligation they have contracted of being faithful to the duties imposed upon them. Bat let not the flock judge their Pastor; since all, both priest and people, are living in expectation of the day of our Saviour's coming ; not only of that second one, for which we are now preparing, but also of that last Coming which will be as terrible as the other two are dear to the hearts of men. After having spoken these words of stern admonition, the Church resumes the expressions of her hopes and her entreaties for the speedy coming of her Spouse.

GOSPEL.

Sequel of the holy Gospel according to Luke.

Oh. III.

Now in the fifteenth year of the reign of Tiberius Caesar, Pontius Pilate being governor of Judea, and Herod Tetrarch of Galilee, and Philip his brother Te- trarch of Iturea and the country of Trachonitis, and Lysanias Tetrarch of Abilina, under the high priests Annas and Caiphas, the word of the Lord came to John, the son of Zachary, in the desert. And he came into all the country about the Jordan, preaching the baptism of penance for the remission of sins : as it was written in the book of the words of Isaias the Prophet : A voice of one crying in the wilder- ness : Prepare ye the way of the Lord : make straight his paths : every valley shall be filled, and every mountain and hill shall be brought low : and the crooked shall be made straight, and the rough ways plain : and all flesh shall see the salvation of God.

Thou art nigh, O Lord, for the inheritance of thy people has passed into the hands of the Gentiles, and the land, which thou didst promise to Abraham, is now but a province of that vast empire, to which thine own is to succeed. The oracles of the Prophets are being rapidly fulfilled, each in its turn ; the predic- tion of Jacob himself has been accomplished : The

Thus it is that thou re- newest the face of the earth ; deign, also, I beseech thee, to renew my heart, and give me courage during these last few hours of my preparation for receiving thee. I feel the need I have of withdrawing into solitude, of receiving the baptism of penance, of making straight all my ways : O divine Saviour, let all this be done in me, that so my joy may be full on the day of thy coming.

During the Offertory, the Church salutes the ever glorious Virgin, in whose chaste womb is still con- cealed the Saviour of the world. Give us, O Mary, this God, who fills thee with himself and his grace. The Lord is with thee, O incomparable Mother ! but the happy hour is rapidly advancing, when he will also be with us ; for his name is Emmanuel.

But thou, Israel, art my servant, Jacob whom I have chosen, the seed of Abraham my friend ; in whom I have taken thee from the ends of the earth, and from the re- mote parts thereof have called thee, and said to thee, thou art my servant, I have chosen thee, and have not cast thee away. Fear not, for I am with thee : turn not aside, for I am thy God : I have strengthened thee, and have helped thee, and the right hand of my Just One hath upheld thee. Behold all that fight against thee shall be confounded and ashamed : they shall be as nothing, and the men shall perish that strive against thee. Thou shalt seek them, and shalt not hnd the men that resist thee: they shall be as nothing and as a thing consumed the men that war against thee : for I am the Lord thy God, who take thee by the hand,

Ne timeas, quia ego tecum sum : ne declines, quia ego Deus tuus : confortavi te, et auxiliatus sum tibi, et suscepit te dextera Justi mei. Ecce confundentur et erubescent omnes qui pugnant adver- sum te : erunt quasi non sint, et peribunt viri qui contra- dicunt tibi.

pieces : and shalt make the hills as chaff. Thou shalt fan them, and the wind shall carry them away, and the whirlwind shall scatter them: and thou shalt rejoice in the Lord, in the Holy One of Israel thou shalt be joyful.

It is thus thou raisest us up from our abject lowliness, O Eternal Son of the Father ! It is thus thou consolest us under the fear we so justly feel by reason of our sins. Thou sayest to us : Israel, my servant I Jacob, whom. I have chosen ! seed of Abraham, in whom I have called thee from the remote parts of the earth ! fear not, for I am with thee. But, O divine Word, how low thou hast had to come, that thou mightest be thus with us ! We could never have come to thee, for between us and thee there was fixed an immense chaos. Nay, we had not' so much as the desire to see thee, so dull of heart bad sin made us ; and had we desired it, our eyes could never have borne the splendour of thy majesty. Then it was, that thou didst descend to us in person, yet so that our weakness could look fixedly upon thee, because veiled under the cloud of thy humanity. " Who . could doubt," says St. Bernard,1 " of there " being some great cause pending, seeing that so " great a Majesty deigned to come down, from so far " off, into so unworthy a place ? 0 yes, there is some

"great thing at stake, for the mercy is great, and "the commiseration is extreme, and the charity is " abundant. And why, think you, did he come ? " He came from the mountain to seek the hundredth "sheep, that was lost. O wonderful condescension, a "God seeking! O wonderful worth of man, that he " should be sought by God ! If man should there- " fore boast, he is surely not unwise ; for he boasts " not for aught that he sees in himself as of himself, " but for his very Maker making such account of him. " All the riches and all the glory of the world, and "all that men covet in it, all is less than this glory, " nay, is nothing, when compared to it. What is man, " 0 Lord, that thou shouldst magnify him ? or why "dost thou set thy Heart upon him?"1 Delay not, then, Good Shepherd ! show thyself to thy sheep. Thou knowest them ; not only hast thou seen them from heaven, thou also lookest on them with love, from the womb of Mary where thou still art concealed. They also wish to know Thee ; they are impatient to behold thy divine features, to hear thy voice, and to follow thee to the pastures thou hast promised them.

Mysterium hoc magnum est : Marise quod concessum est, Ut Deum per quern omnia Ex se videret prodire.

Vere gratia plena es, Et gloriosa permanes, Quia ex te natus est Christus Per quern facta sunt omnia.

Rogemus ergo, populi, Dei Matrem et Virginem, Ut ipsa nobis impetret, Pacem et indulgentiam.

Gloria tibi, Domine, Qui natus es de Virgine, Cum Patre et Sancto Spiritu, In sempiterna ssecula.

Amen.

This is a great mystery, that is given to Mary : that she should see the God, who created all things, become .her own child !

How truly art thou full of grace, ever glorious Virgin ! for of thee is born the Christ, by whom all things were made.

Come then, ye people, let us pray to the Virgin Mother of God, that she would ob- tain for us peace and in- dulgent mercy.

Glory be to thee, O Lord, who wast born of the Vir- gin ! and to the Father and the Holy Ghost, for ever- lasting ages.

Ch. XLII.

Behold my servant, I will uphold him ; my elect, my soul delighteth in him ; I have given my Spirit upon him, he shall bring forth judgment to the Gentiles. He shall not cry, nor have respect to person, neither shall his voice be heard abroad. The bruised reed he shall not break, and the smoking flax he shall not quench : he shall bring forth judgment unto truth. He shall not be sad, nor trouble- some, till he set judgment in the earth : and the islands shall wait for his law. Thus saith the Lord God that created the heavens, and stretched them out : that established the earth, and the things that spring out of it : that giveth breath to the people upon it, and spirit to them that tread thereon. I the Lord have called thee in justice, and taken thee by the

covenant of the people, for a light of the Gentiles : that - thou mightest open the eyes of the blind, and bring forth the prisoner out of prison, and them that sit in darkness out of the prison- house.

How sweet and peaceful is thy entrance into this world, O Jesus ! Thy voice is not heard giving its commands ; and thy hands, the hands of a yet unborn babe, seem too weak to break the reed, so frail, that a breath would break it. What is it thou art come to do in this first Coming ? Thy heavenly Father tells it us by the Prophet. Thou art coming that thou mayest be the pledge of a covenant between heaven and earth. O divine Infant ! Son of God, and yet Son of man, blessed be thy Coming among us ! Thy crib will be the Ark which will save us ; and when thou walkest on our earth, it will be to give us light, and set us free from our prison-house of darkness. It is just, therefore, that we should rise and meet thee on thy approach, seeing that thou hast come all this way to us. " If the sick man cannot go " out some distance to meet so great a Physician," says St. Bernard, " let him, at least, make an effort to " raise his head and turn towards him as he enters. * It is not required of thee, O man ! to pass the seas, " or ascend the clouds, or cross the Alps. The way " that is shown unto thee is not a long one ; go as " far as thy own self, and there meet thy God : for " the word is nigh thee, even in thy mouth, and in " thy heart.1 Meet him at least at thy heart's com- " punction, and thy mouth's confession, that thou " mayest at least go out of- the filth of thy guilty

Glory be to thee, for having checked the breath of thy almighty justice, and so cherishing the last spark left in the smoking flax, that it might burn up again, and give light at the Bridegroom's feast.

HYMN IN HONOUR OF THE BLESSED VIRGIN.

(Com,

by St. Peter Damian.)

May all earth and heaven be glad and resound with the praises which, in this double choir, are sung to the maternity of the Virgin. .Yea, this Virgin, Mother of the Word, is made the Gate of heaven ; she gave God to the world, and, by this, opened heaven to us.

This happy Mother of Jesus conceived him without humiliation, and bore him without a moan ; such a Mother could not be under the law put on Eve.

O that rich treasury of Mary's womb ! it held the price which purchased our redemption, setting us free from the yoke of our debt. O happy we !

The Son <of the Eternal Father dwelt within her ; the Holy Ghost overshadowed her ; what is such a Virgin's womb but a new-made Heaven ]

Terrena cuncta jubilent, Astra laudibus intonent, Virginis ante thalamum, Laudes alternent dramatum.

Hsec Virgo Verbo gravida, Fit paradisi Janua ; Quse Deum mundo reddidit, Caelum nobis aperuit.

Felix ista Puerpera, Evse lege Uberrima, Concepit sine masculo, Peperit absque gemitu.

Dives Marise gremium ! Mundi gestavit pretium, Quo gloriamur redimi Soluti jugo debiti.

Quam Patris implet Filius, Sanctus obumbrat Spiritus Ccelum fiunt castissima Sacrse puellse viscera.

The Lord therefore will com- fort Sion, and will comfort all the ruins thereof, and he will make her desert as a place of pleasure, and her wilderness as the garden of the Lord. Joy and gladness shall be found therein, thanksgiving and the voice of praise. Hearken unto me, O my people, and give ear to me, O my tribes : for a law shall go forth from me, and my judgment shall rest to be a light of the nations.

O Jesus, thou Flower of the Field, thou Lily of the Valley, thy visit is to change our barren parched earth into a garden of delights ! We had lost Eden and all its lovely magnificence, by our sins ; and lo ! Eden is restored to us ; thou art coming, that thou mayest set it in our hearts. O heavenly plant ! tree of life, transplanted from heaven to earth, thou first takest root in Mary, that faithful soil ; and thence thou wilt come to us, and we must be to thee a grate- ful land, cherishing the divine seed and making it fructify. Let it be so, O divine Husbandman ! who didst appear to Magdalene under the form of a gar- dener. Thou knowest how far are our hearts from be- ing ready for thy working in them. Move, and break, and water this land; the season is come; our hearts long to be fertile, and to have growing within them that exquisite Flower which makes the beauty of all heaven, and comes down to hide its splendour for a time here below.

HYMN OF PREPARATION FOR CHRISTMAS.

{Composed by St. Ambrose. It is in the Ambrosian Breviary for first Vespers of Christmas, and in the ancient Roman- French Breviaries?)

Come, 0 Redeemer of mankind ! reveal to us the Virgin's delivery : let all ages be in admiration : for what other birth would have been worthy of God %

Not of man, but of the Holy Ghost, was the Word of God made flesh, and the fruit of the womb ripened.

The Virgin has become Mother, and yet the Mother is still a Virgin. It is the banner of omnipotence which here shines ; God is come into his temple.

He comes forth from the royal palace of virginity, as from his bride-chamber, that he may exultingly run the way, as a Giant, who is both God and Man.

He comes forth from the Father ; he returns to the Father : he descends into hell ; he ascends to the throne of God.

Co-equal Son of the eter- nal Father, gird thee with the trophy of the flesh ; strengthening the weaknesses of our flesh by thy unfailing power.

Thy crib is already re- splendent, and the night

Veni, Redemptor gentium, Ostende partum Virginis ; Miretur omne sseculum, Talis decet partus Deum.

Non ex virili semine, Sed mystico spiramine, Verbum Dei factus est caro Fructusque ventris floruit.

Alvus tumescit Virginis, Claustra pudoris permanent, Vexilla virtutum micant, Versatur in templo Deus.

Procedit e thalamo suo, Pudoris aula regia, Gemmae gigas substantias, Alacris ut currat viam.

Lord God omnipotent ! who, for the redemption of the human race, didst deign to send even unto us, by the message of an Angel and by the Virgin Mary's womb, thy co-eternal and co-equal Son ; grant us, in this time of the Advent of thy Only Son, that same grace of peace which thou hast mercifully bestowed upon the past ages, and number us among those who, at the first beginning of the faith, were accept- able to him by embracing the faith ; and who, being washed in the water of penance by John, were after- wards baptised by thee, through thy Son, in the Holy Ghost and fire.

O that thou wouldst rend the heavens, and wouldst come down ; the mountains would melt away at thy pre- sence ; they would melt as at the burning of tire ; the waters would burn with fire ; that thy name might be made known to thy enemies : that the nations might tremble at thy presence. When thou shalt do wonder- ful things, we shall not bear them : thou didst come clown, and at thy presence the mountains melted away. From the beginning of the world they have not heard, nor perceived with the ears : the eye hath not seen, O God, besides thee, what things thou hast prepared for them that wait for thee. Thou hast met him that re- joiceth, and doth justice : in thy ways they shall remem- ber thee : behold thou art angry, and we have sinned ; in them we have been always, and we shall be saved.

Do- hand of our iniquity. And mus sanctificationis nostras, now, 0 Lord, thou art our et glorias nostras, ubi lauda- Father, and we are clay : verunt te patres nostri, facta and thou art our maker, and est in exustionem ignis : et we all are the works of thy omnia desiderabilia nostra hands. Be not very angry, versa sunt in ruinas. O Lord, and remember no

longer our iniquity : behold, see, we are all thy people. The city of thy sanctuary is become a desert, Sion is made a desert, Jerusalem is desolate. The house of our holiness, and of our glory, where our fathers praised thee, is burnt with fire, and all our lovely things are turned into ruins.

0 God of our Fathers ! delay not, but show thyself unto us. The city, which thou lovest, is desolate ; come and raise up Jerusalem ; avenge the glory of her temple. This was the cry of the Prophet ; thou hast heard it, and art come to deliver Sion from her captivity, giving her a new era of glory and holiness. Thou art come, not to destroy but to fulfil the law ; and, by thy visit, Sion has been changed into the Church, thy Spouse. But why, 0 thou her Beloved Saviour ! why hast thou turned away thy face ? Why is this Church of thy love left in the wilder- ness, weeping like Jeremias over the ruins of the Sanctuary, and as Rachel over her children that had been taken from her? Why has her inheritance

been delivered to the stranger ? By thy power, she had become the mother of countless children ; she had nourished them ; she had taught them, in thy name, the things that pertain to the present and the future life ; and these ungrateful children have turned against her. She has been driven from nation to nation, bearing away with her the heavenly treasure of Faith ; her mysteries have ceased to be celebrated where once they were the glory and happiness of the people ; and from thy throne above, O divine Word, Creator of the universe, thou seest everywhere throughout the earth altars overturned, and temples profaned. Oh! come, then, and rekindle the smoul- dering fire of Faith.

Remember thy Apostles and thy Martyrs ; re- member thy Saints who have founded Churches, and honoured them by their virtues and miracles ; re- member thy Spouse the Church, and support her during her earthly pilgrimage, until the number of thy elect is filled up. She longs to possess thee in the eternal light of the vision ; but thou hast given her a heart with such mother's love, that she will not leave her children as long as there be one to save, nor cease to save until that day come when there shall no more be a Militant Church, but the one sole Triumphant Church, inebriated with the enjoyment of the sight and embraces of her God. But that last day is not yet come, 0 Jesus ! there is yet time for thee to descend from heaven and visit thy vineyard. Restore to the branches of the tree the leaves which had fallen in the storm of iniquity. Let this tree of thy predilection bud forth new branches ; and the old ones, v/hich had separated from it, and seemed to force thy justice to cast them in the fire, let them be once more grafted to the parent trunk, so torn by their rupture from her. Come, O Jesus, for the sake of thy Church ; she is dearer to thee than was the Jerusalem of old.

Hear the word of the Lord, you that tremble at his word. Your brethren that hate you, and cast you out for my name's sake, have said : Let the Lord be glorified, and we shall see in your joy : but they shall be confounded. A voice of the people from the city, a voice from the temple, the voice of the Lord that rendereth recompense to his enemies. Before she was in labour, she brought forth : before her time came to be delivered, she brought forth a man-child. Who hath ever heard such a thing'? And who hath seen the like of this % Shall the earth bring forth in one day 1 or shall a nation be brought forth at once, because Sion hath been in labour, and hath brought forth her children? Shall not I that make others to bring forth children, myself bring forth, saith the Lord ? Shall I, that give generation to others, be barren, saith

For thus saith the Lord: Behold I will bring upon her as it were a river of peace, and as an overflowing torrent the glory of the Gen- tiles, which you shall suck : you shall be carried at the breasts, and upon the knees they shall caress you. As one whom the mother caress- eth, so will I comfort you, and you shall be comforted in Jerusalem. You shall see, and your heart shall rejoice, and your bones shall flourish like an herb, and the hand of the Lord shall be known to his servants, and he shall be angry with his enemies. For behold the Lord will come with fire, and his chariots are like a whirlwind : to render his wrath in indignation, and his rebuke with flames of fire : for the Lord shall judge by fire : and by his sword unto all flesh, and the slain of the Lord shall be many.

Quomodo si cui mater blandiatur, ita ego consolabor vos, et in Jerusa- lem consolabimini.

Thy presence, O Jesus, will give fruitfulness to her that was barren, and the despised Sion shall sud- denly bring forth a people which the world is too small to hold. But all the glory of this fruitfulness belongs to thee, O divine Word ! The Psalmist had foretold it, when speaking to Jerusalem, as to a

272 ADVENT.

Queen, he said to her : Instead of thy fathers, sons are born to thee ; thou shalt make them princes over all the earth : they shall remember thy name through- out all generations; therefore shall people praise thee for ever and ever, yea for ever and ever.1 But, for this end it was necessary that God himself should come down in person. He alone could make a Yirgin- Mother; he alone could raise up children to Abraham out of the very stones. Yet one little while, as he says by one of his Prophets, and I will "move heaven and earth, and I tvill move all nations.2 And by another : From the rising of the sun even to the going down, my name is great among the Gentiles ; and in every place there is sacrifice, and there is offered to my name a clean oblation? There will soon be, then, but one Sacrifice ; for the Lamb, who is to be offered in that Sacrifice, will be born in a few hours hence; and since Sacrifice is the bond of union among men, when there shall be but one Sacrifice, there will be but one People.

Come then quickly, O Church of God, that art to unite us all into one; come and be born into our world. And since for us thy children thou art already born, may the Lamb, thy Spouse, pour out upon thee the river of peace announced by the Prophet ; may he open out upon thee the glory of the Gentiles, as an overflowing torrent; may the nations cluster round thee as their common Mother, and be filled with the abundance of thy glory, with the breasts of thy consolations ; and thou carry them on thy heart and caress them in thy tender love. O Jesus! it is thou that hast inspired our Mother with this won- derful love ; it is thou that consolest us, and en- lightenest us, by her. Come to her and visit her; come, and, by the New Birth thou art about to take among us, renew her life within her. Give her, during this year also, firmness of Faith, the Grace of

the Sacraments, the efficacy of Prayer, the Gift of Miracles, the Succession of her Hierarchy, power of Government, Fortitude against the Princes of the world, love of the Cross, victory over Satan, and the crown of Martyrdom. During this new year, make her, as ever, thy beautiful Spouse ; make her faith- ful to thy love, and more than ever successful in the great work thou hast put upon her ; for each year brings us nearer to the day when thou wilt come for the last time, not in the swathing bands of infancy, but on a cloud, with great majesty, to render thy re- buke with flames of fire, and destroy those that have despised or have not loved thy Church, which thou wilt then raise up and admit into thy eternal King- dom.

HYMN OF THE BIRTH OF CHRIST. (Taken from the Poet Prudentius. vni. kal. januarias.)

Come forth, sweet Babe ! Child of Chastity, Child of a Virgin Mother ! Come, O thou our Mediator, Man and God.

Though thou didst come, in time, from the mouth of the Most High Father, and becamest incarnate at the Angel's word; yet hadst thou, O eternal Wisdom, dwelt for ever in the bosom of thy Father.

This eternal Wisdom ma- nifested itself when it made heaven, light, and the other creatures ; by the power of the Word were all these made, for the Word is God.

But having thus created the world, and fixed the laws of the universe, this creator and maker still left not his Father's bosom.

Emerge, dulcis Pusio, Quern Mater edit castitas, Parens et expers conjugis, Mediator, et duplex genus.

Ex ore quamlibet Patris Sis ortus, et verbo editus, Tamen paterno inpectore Sophia callebas prius.

Quse prompta ccelum con- didit, Ccelum, diemque et caetera, Virtute Verbi effecta sunt Hsec cuncta : nam Verbum Deus.

Sed ordinatis sseculis, Rerumque digesto statu, Fundator ipse et artifex Permansit in Patris sinu.

Until at length thousands of years rolled on, and then he deigned to visit the world grown old in sin.

For man, blinded with passion, paid adoration to empty vanities, and believed that brass, or stiff blocks of stone and wood, were God.

Abandoned to idolatry, they became the slaves of the treacherous enemy, and plunged their enslaved souls into dark abyss.

But the Son of God com- passionated this destruction of his fallen creatures ; for it was the ruin of his Father's image.

He took to himself a mor- tal body, that by the resur- rection of that body he might break the chain of death, and raise up man to his Father.

Thouforebodest'his suffer- ings, O noble Virgin ! and yet to give birth to this thy Son is an honour which adds fresh lustre to thy spotless purity.

John, the faithful friend, was the precursor in birth, the pre- cursor in preaching in the wilderness, the precursor in baptism, preparing thus the way to the Judge and Re- deemer. He called sinners to repentance ; and purchasing a people for the Saviour, he baptised in the Jordan them that confessed their sins. He conferred not the full grace which regenerates man, but taught him to look for the Coming of the most merciful Saviour. He remitted not the sins of them that came unto him, but he promised the future remission of sins to believers ; that thus they, who went down into the waters of penance, might hope for a merciful cure and forgiveness from Him, who, they were told, was to come full of the gift of Truth and Grace, our Lord Jesus Christ.

The Vigil of Christmas is given below in the Proper of Saints, December 24, page 532.

ADVENT

PROPER OF THE SAINTS.

We give the title of Proper of Saints to that portion of our work, which contains the Feasts of Saints, and all such parts of the Advent proper Office as have a fixed day ; for example, the great Antiphons, the Vigil of Christmas, &c. This division into Proper of the Time and Proper of Saints is that which is adopted by the Breviary and Missal, and is familiar to all those who frequent the Divine Service.

Our readers will have observed in the Proper of the Time of Advent, how intent the holy Church is in preparing for the great feast of the Nativity of our Lord ; in the Proper of Saints, they will find her celebrating, with all possible devotion, the feasts of the Friends of God, the Saints, which come during that time. Our separated brethren accuse the Catholic Church of giving a place in the Liturgy, to the cultus of the Saints, which belongs to God alone. They are led to make this accusation, which involves a very serious error, from having never considered, firstly, that the homage paid to God in his Saints rebounds to His glory who made them Saints ; and secondly, that, at the same time that the Church honours the Saints by keeping their feasts, she pays to the sove- reign and incommunicable majesty of God more acts of religion, in one short week, than Protestantism could possibly do in a whole year.

Let us, children of the Church, love and practise

devotion to the Saints, and remember how God, who demands our homage, requires us to pay that portion of it which consists in honouring him in those whom he has crowned. Now, the first homage which we ought to pay to God in his Saints is, to study to know them. One of the evils of our times is, that the Saints are not sufficiently known. Protestant rationalism, under the false name of Criticism, has done its utmost, during the last two hundred years, to lessen the devotion of the faithful towards the Saints ; and one is often surprised and shocked to meet with persons, otherwise well instructed, and attached to the faith, who know little about the Saints, and have imbibed most uncatholic prejudices regarding them. But, if we may judge from the interest with which some very full and well written lives have been re- cently received, these prejudices are fast disappearing, and the time is come when hagiography will become, once more, a serious study amongst our people, and the ancient devotion to the Saints be revived.

To further this happy tendency, we have resolved to imitate the Church herself, by giving the greatest development, in these pages, to all that regards the honour due to the Saints. Firstly, the faithful must be got to know them. No method, it seemed to us, could be more effectual to this end, than the one adopted by the Church. She is most desirous that her children should know the heroes of sanctity whom God has given to her, and in whom, together with the incomparable Mother of God and the Holy Angels, she puts her greatest hope, after that which she places in her Saviour Jesus Christ, the King and Master and Head of all the Saints. The faithful should, there- fore, understand that the Church keeps an official register of the actions, and maxims, and virtues of the Saints, wTho are her glory; there she has chro- nicled, through all these eighteen hundred years, the wonders which God has wrought in them and by

PROPER OF SAINTS. 279

them, and the blessings she has received through their intercession. This admirable history of the Saints is known under the name of the Legends of the Breviary ; a history which the Church is ever writing, for God is ever adding to the number of his Saints ; a history, which the learned admire for its great beauty of style, and in which the children of the Church find that unction which has such power over the heart, and which the Catholic Church alone can put into human language. This is not the place to notice the objections which some critics have made to certain passages of some of the Legends, of which they contest the historical exactitude ; besides, they are very few and of little importance.

We therefore give, in this work, the Roman Le- gends, just as they are in the Breviary. By this means, we shall be giving a general idea of the life and actions of the Saints to those who are completely ignorant of them. Even they who have grown familiar with the Lives of the Saints by having read such as are in general use, even they will sometimes find, in these Legends of the Church, a very different, if not contrary, appreciation of the conduct of the Saints from that which has been put upon it by modern writers. They will find, that notwithstand- ing their brevity, the Legends of the Breviary are often more complete and explicit than some of the Lives they have read, which consisted of twenty or more pages. As to the doctrinal and moral apprecia- tion, which almost necessarily accompany the written Lives of the Saints, a Catholic should remember that when they come from the Church, they have for their guarantee the authority of God himself.

After having received from the Church herself the knowledge we ought to have of the Saints, we ought also to learn from her how we are to honour them. For this reason, we shall first insert the prayers, which the usage of the Church consecrated, in a manner, to

280 ADVENT.

them in ancient times ; and then, those which were composed at a later period. Our work will thus become a complete manual of Catholic devotion to the Saints, giving, first, the formulae used in the uni- versal Church ; secondly, those which were com- posed during the first and middle ages of the Latin Churches ; and thirdly, those which were in use in the several churches of the East.

In order to give unity to these various liturgies, we shall continue the method we adopted in the Proper of the Time. A simple and concise commen- tary shall be given throughout the entire course of our work, explaining the several intentions of the Church in the prayers and usages, which we shall have to give. But with regard to everything which is strictly of the province of science and archaeology, we shall use a prudent reserve, as such details will come better in a special Treatise.

To derive solid advantage from the devotion we pay to the Saints in the various seasons of the year, it is important that we should not disjoin the honour we give to them from that which we have to pay to the Mysteries of our redemption, which the Christian Year gradually brings before us, and which form the basis of the Proper of the Time, throughout the entire Cycle. It will not be difficult to do this ; for if we read over the Catholic Calendar with an eye of faith, we shall not fail to see the secret relation, which unites the Feasts of the Saints with the various mystical seasons, in which they, as it were, bloom. A Saint's feast is, generally, kept on the very day of his death ; in other words, on the day of his entrance into heaven. That infinite Wisdom, — which has revealed to us that not even a hair of our head shall perish without our Heavenly Father's having willed it, — in choosing one day in preference to all others for the Saint's death, may, surely, be supposed to have selected it, because it would be in

PROPER OF SAINTS. 281

keeping with the supernatural harmony of the Church's year. It should, therefore, be our duty to study, during the whole of the Liturgical Year, the relation, which the Saints, whose feasts are being kept, have with the Season in which the Church celebrates their memory.

As the Office of the Church, in Advent, does riot assign a Saint's feast for each day, we have thought it advisable to fill up the vacant days by giving for each day, from December 1st to Christmas Eve, reflections upon the events which preceded the divine Mystery of the Birth of Jesus. Our object is to aid the piety of the faithful, by offering them meditations, both upon the facts related in the Sacred Scriptures, and upon the pious conjectures which almost irresistibly suggest themselves.

Lastly, in order to impress the spirit of this holy time more deeply on the mind, we have, on each day of this second part of our volume, given a liturgical prayer, taken from the Advent Offices of the various Churches : and thus we shall be saying, each day, an additional prayer for the Messias to come; a prayer, too, which must be efficacious, be- cause offered to the Divine Majesty in the words of our holy Mother the Church.

282 ADVENT.

November 30. SAINT ANDREW, APOSTLE.

We open our Proper of Saints for Advent with St. Andrew, because, although his feast frequently occurs before this holy season has begun, it some- times happens that we have entered Advent when the memory of this great Apostle has to be celebrated by the Church. This Feast is therefore destined to terminate, with solemnity, the Cycle which is at its close, or to add lustre to the new one which has just begun. It seems, indeed, fitting that the Christian Year should begin and end with the Cross, which has merited for us each of those years which it has pleased the divine goodness to grant us, and which is to appear, on the last day, in the clouds of heaven, as the seal put on Time.

We should remember that Saint Andrew is the Apostle of the Cross. To Peter, Jesus has given firmness of Faith ; to John, warmth of Love ; the mission of Andrew is to represent the Cross of his divine Master. Now it is by these three, Faith, Love, and the Cross, that the Church renders herself worthy of her Spouse. Everything she has or is, bears this threefold character. Hence it is that after the two Apostles just named, there is none who holds such a prominent place in the universal Liturgy as Saint Andrew.

But let us read the life of this glorious fisherman of the lake of Genesareth, who was afterwards to be the successor of Christ himself, and the companion of

Peter, on the tree of the Cross. The Church has compiled it from the ancient Acts of the Martyrdom of the holy Apostle, drawn up by the Priests of the Church of Patrse, which was founded by the Saint. The authenticity of this venerable piece has been contested by Protestants, inasmuch as it makes mention of several things which would militate against them. Their sentiment has been adopted by several critics of the 17th and 18th centuries. On the other hand, these Acts have been received by a far greater number of Catholic writers of eminence ; amongst whom may be mentioned the great Baron ius, Labbe, Natalis Alexander, Gallandus, Lumper, Mor- celli, &c. The Churches, too, both East and West, which have inserted these Acts in their respective Offices of St. Andrew, are of some authority, as is also St. Bernard, who has made them the ground- work of his three admirable Sermons on Saint Andrew.

Andrew, the Apostle, born at Bethsaida, a town of Galilee, was brother of Peter, and disciple of John the Baptist. Having heard his master say, speaking of Christ : Behold the Lamb of God ! he followed J esus, and brought to him his brother also. When, afterwards, he was fishing with his brother in the sea of Galilee, they were both called, before any of the other Apostles, by our Lord, who, passing by, said to them : Come after me ; I will make you to be fishers of men. Without delay, they left their nets and followed him. After the passion and resurrection, Andrew went to spread the faith of Christ

in Scythia in Europe, which was the province assigned to him ; then he travelled through Epirus and Thrace, and by his teaching and miracles converted inumer- able souls to Christ. After- wards, having reached Patrae in Achaia, he persuaded many in that city to embrace the truth of the Gospel. Find- ing that the Proconsul iEgeas resisted the preaching of the Gospel, he most freely up- braided him for that he, who desired to be considered as a judge of men, should be so far deceived by devils as not to acknowledge Christ to be God, the Judge of all.

Then iEgeas being angry, said : Cease to boast of this Christ, whom such like words as these kept not from being crucified by the Jews. But finding that Andrew con- tinued boldly preaching that Christ had offered himself to be crucified for the salvation of mankind, he interrupts him by an impious speech, and at length exhorts him to look to his own interest and sacrifice to the gods. Andrew answered him : I offer up every day to almighty God, who is one and true, not the flesh of oxen, nor the blood of goats, but the spotless Lamb upon the altar ; of whose flesh the whole mul- titude of the faithful eat, and the Lamb that is sacrificed, remains whole and living. Whereupon vEgeas being ex- ceeding angry, orders him to

be thrust into prison, whence the people would easily have freed Andrew, had he not himself appeased the multi- tude, begging of them, with most earnest entreaty, that they would not keep him from the long-sought-for crown of martyrdom, to which he was hastening.

Not long after this, he was brought before the tribunal, where he began to extol the mystery of the Cross, and rebuke the judge for his im- piety. iEgeas, no longer able to contain himself on hearing these words, ordered him to be hoisted on a cross, and so to die like Christ. Andrew, having been brought to the place of execution, seeing the Cross at some distance, began to cry out : O good Cross, made beautiful by the body of my Lord ! so long desired, so anxiously loved, so unceas- ingly sought after, and now at last ready for my soul to enjoy ! take me from amidst men, and restore me to my Master, that by thee He may receive me, who by thee re- deemed me. He was there- fore fastened to the cross, on which he hung alive two days, preaching without cessation the faith of Christ : after which he passed to Him, whose death he had so covet- ed. The Priests and Deacons of Achaia, who wrote his Pas- sion, attest that all the things which they have recorded were heard and seen by them. His relics were first translated to Constantinople,

Let us now listen to the several Churches on earth, celebrating the grand triumph of our Apostle. Let us begin with Rome, the Mother and Mistress of all Churches. Nothing could be more expressive than the language she uses in praise of the Apostle of the Cross. First, she employs the words of the Gospel, which record the circumstances of his voca- tion; then, she selects the most touching passages from the Acts of his martyrdom, drawn up by the Priests of Patrse ; and both are intermingled with appropriate sentiments of her own. Our first selec- tion shall be from the Responsories of Matins.

1$. When the Lord was walking by the sea of Galilee, he saw Peter and Andrew casting nets into the sea, and he called them, saying : * Come after me, I will make you to be fishers of men. ft. For they were fishers, and he saith to them : * Come after me, I will make you to be fishers of men.

]$. As soon as blessed Andrew heard the voice of the Lord calling him, leaving his nets, by the use and work- ing of which he lived, * He followed him who gives the reward of eternal life. ft. This is he who, for the love of Christ, hung upon a cross, and for his law endured a passion. * He followed Him who gives the reward of eternal life.

Inventoque fratre suo Bar- jona : Invenimus, ait ovans, Messiam.

Et duxit eum ad dulcifluam Salvatoris prassentiain.

Hunc perscrutantem ma- ria, Christi vocavit dementia.

Artem piscandi commu- tans dignitate apostolica.

Hujus animam post clara festi Paschalis gaudia,

Sancti Spiritus prseclara perlustravit potentia ;

Ad praedicandum populis posnitentiam, et Dei Pa- ths per Filium clementiam.

Gratulare ergo tanto patre, Achaia ;

Illustrata ejus salutari doctrina ;

Honorata multimoda sig- norum frequentia.

Et tu gem ens plora, trux carnifex iEgea.

Te lues inferna et mors tenet seterna.

Sed Andream felicia per Cmcem manent gaudia.

Jam Regem tuum spectas, jam in ejus conspectu, An- drea, stas.

Odorem suavitatis jam adspiras, quern divini amoris aroma dat.

cce-

Sis ergo nobis inclyta dulcedo, spirans intima lestis vitae balsama.

Amen.

And finding his own brother, Barjona, he said to him with great joy : We have found 'the Messias.

And he led him to the loved presence of the Saviour.

As Andrew was fishing in the sea, the mercy of Christ called him,

Giving him, in exchange for his art of fishing, the dig- nity of an Apostle.

His soul, after the grand joys of the Paschal feast,

Was visited by the glorious power of the Holy Ghost,

That he might go and preach penance to the world, and tell it of the mercy of the Father by the Son.

Rejoice, then, O Achaia ! that thou hast such an Apos- tle,

Who enlightened thee with his saving doctrine,

And honoured thee with his many and manifold miracles.

But thou fierce torturer, iEgeas, cry and weep :

The pains of hell and eter- nal death are thine :

Whilst Andrew has won happiness and joy . by his Cross.

O Andrew ! now thou seest thy King : now thou art in his presence ;

Now thou art breathing the odour of sweetness, which comes from the aroma of di- vine love.

Be, then, unto us a deli- cious sweetness, giving out the hidden balsam of the ce- lestial life.

Amen.

The second Sequence, written in rhythm and correct metre, is the composition of the pious Adam of Saint Victor, the greatest lyric poet of the Middle Ages.

SEQUENCE.

Let us exult and rejoice, and be delighted in the praises sung to Andrew the Apostle.

His faith, and teachings, and actions, and all his la- bours for Christ, deserve a worthy celebration.

'Twas he led Peter to the faith. 'Twas he on whom the Light first shone ; the Bap- tist showed it him.

Near the sea of Galilee, our Lord called Peter and An- drew by the one same elec- tion.

They who were once fish- ermen, are become heralds of the Word, and models of every virtue.

They let down their nets for a draught of men ; and carefully watch over the in- fant Church.

Andrew is separated from his brother, and sent into the country about Achaia.

A great portion of that province enters, by the grace of God, into Andrew's net.

The holy and learned Doc- tor forms the heart of his people by his faith, life, preaching, and miracles.

When iEgeas discovered what Andrew had done, he was excited to great anger.

But Andrew's mind, ever calm and manly, set little value on this life, and armed itself with patience.

Exsultemus et lsetemur : Et Andreae delectemur Laudibus Apostoli.

Hujus fidem, dogma, mo- res, Et pro Christo tot labores, Digne decet recoli.

Hie ad fidem Petrum duxit, Cui primum lux illuxit, Joannis indicio.

Secus mare Galihese, Petri simul et Andreee Sequitur electio.

Ambo prius piscatores, Verbi fiunt assertores, Et forma justitise.

Eete laxant in capturam ; Vigilemque gerunt curam Nascentis Ecclesise.

A fratre dividitur, Et in partes mittitur Andreas Achaise.

In Andreas retia Currit, Dei gratia, Magna pars provincise.

Fide, vita, verbo, signis, Doctor pius et insignis Cor informat populi.

Ut iEgeas comperit Quid Andreas egerit, Irse surgunt stimuli.

Mens secura, mens virilis, Cui prsesens vita vilis, Viget patientia.

Blandimentis aut tormen- tis Non enervat robur mentis Judicis insania.

Crucem videns praeparari, Suo gestit conformari Magistro discipulus.

Mors pro morte solvitur, Et Crucis appetitur Triumphalis titulus.

In cruce vixit biduum, Victurus in perpetuum : Nee vult volente populo Deponi de patibulo.

Hora fere dimidia, Luce perfusus nimia, Cum luce, cum laetitia, Pergit ad lucis atria.

O Andrea gloriose, Cujus preces pretiosae, Cujus mortis luminosse Dulcis et memoria.

Ab hac valle lacryma- rum, Nos ad illud lumen clarum, Pie Pastor animarum, Tua transfer gratia.

Amen.

The senseless judge offers him his favour, or threatens him with tortures, but cannot shake his constant soul.

Seeing the Cross was being prepared, Andrew, as a true disciple, is proud to be thus made like his Master.

He repays the death of Jesus by his own, ambitious to have the trophy of triumph, the Cross.

He lived two days hanging on that Cross, which was to make him live for ever ; the people resolve to loose him from it : but he would not have it so ; and clings to his Cross.

An exceeding bright light surrounds him for nearly half an hour ; and then, in this light, and in this joy, he mounts to the realms of light,

0 glorious Andrew, whose prayers are so precious, and whose bright death is so sweet to think on,

Take us, by thy loving prayers, from this vale of tears, and transfer us to that fair land of light, O thou good Shepherd of souls.

Amen.

The pieces so far given belong to the Roman Liturgy, being taken from the books of this Mother of Churches, or from those of the different Churches of the West, which follow the form of her Offices. We will now give, in honour of our holy Apostle, some of the formulae, which the other ancient Litur- gies used for his feast; we will begin wdth the Ambrosian Rite, from which we take the following beautiful Preface.

NOV. SO. ST. ANDREW, APOSTLE.

2.93

PREFACE.

It is truly meet and just, right and available to salva- tion, that we should always, and in all places, give thanks to thee, O holy Lord, Al- mighty Father, Eternal God ; for we are keeping the feast of a sacred mystery, a day on which the blessed Andrew showed himself to be indeed the brother of Peter the Apostle, both by his preach- ing and his confession of thy Christ ; and filled up the measure of the apostolic dignity by his passion and his glory ; for what he had loudly and boldly preached, he would not cease to pro- claim even on his cross : and he deserved to follow, during life, the author of eternal life, and to imitate him in the manner of his death ; that thus having, in obe- dience to his precept, cruci- fied in himself all earthly desires, he might, in accord- ance with his example, be fastened to a cross. The two brothers, the two fishermen, are both, therefore, raised up to heaven by a cross ; that so, having been, by thy grace, bound together by so many ties during this life, they might also be like each other by the crown they wear in heaven ; and as their combat was the same, their reward might be the same.

The Gallican Liturgy also celebrated the glories of St. Andrew. Amongst the few fragments which

Vere dignum et justum est, asquum et salutare, nos tibi semper et ubique gratias agere, Domine sancte, Pater omnipotens, asterne Deus. Adest enim nobis dies sacri votiva mysterii : qua beatus Andreas germanum se Petri Apostoli tarn prasdicatione Christi tui, quam confes- sione monstravit ; et aposto- licas numerum dignitatis simul passione supplevit et gloria ; ut id, quod libera praedicaverat voce, nee pen- dens taceret in cruce : aucto- remque vitas perennis tam in hac vita sequi, quam in mor- tis genere meruit imitari : ut cujus praecepto terrena in semetipso crucifixerat desi- deria, ejus exemplo ipse pati- bulo figeretur. Utrique igi- tur germani piscatores, ambo cruce elevantur ad ccelum ; ut, quos in hujus vitas cursu tua gratia tot vinculis pieta- tis constrinxerat, hos similis in regno coslorum necteret et corona : et quibus erat una causa certaminis, una retributio esset et prasmii.

have been handed down to us of this Liturgy, there is not a single piece in poetry. The following Pre- face, or, as it was then called, Contestation, will show that the Church of Gaul, from the fourth to the eighth centuries, shared the enthusiasm of the Roman and Ambrosian Churches for the glorious Apostle of the Cross.

CONTESTATION.

Dignum et justum est; aequum et justum est : pie- tati tuse ineffabiles gratias referre, omnipotens sempi- terne Deus ; et insestimabili gaudio passionem tuorum praedicare Sanctorum, per Christum Dominum nos- trum. Qui beato Andreas in prima vocatione dedit fidem ; et in passione donavit victo- riam. Acceperat hasc utra- que beatus Andreas ; ideo habebat et in prsedicatione constantiam, et in passione tolerantiam. Qui post iniqua verbera, post earceris septa, alligatus suspendio se purum sacriiicium tibi obtulit Deo. Extendit mitissimus brachia ad ccelos ; ampiectitur crucis vexillum ; defigit in osculis ora : Agni cognoscit arcana. Denique dum ad patibulum duceretur, in cruce suspen- deretur, carne patiebatur, et Spiritu loquebatur. Obli- viscitur crucis tormenta ; dum de cruce Christum prse- conat. Quantum enim cor- pus ejus in ligno extendeba- tur : tantum in lingua ejus Christus exaltabatur; quia pendens in ligno, sociari se ei gratulabatur. Absolvi se

It is meet and just ; it is right and just, that we. should give ineffable thanks to thy mercy, O almighty and eternal God ! and cele- brate with incomparable joy the sufferings of thy Saints, through Christ our Lord : Who gave to the blessed Andrew, at his first calling him, the gift of faith; and in his martyrdom, victory. Both had the blessed An- drew received ; therefore had he constancy in his preach- ing, and patience in his pas- sion. After being unjustly scourged, and thrust into prison, he was tied to a gib- bet, and on it offered him- self a pure sacrifice to thee his God. Most gentle Saint, he lifts up his hands to heaven ; he embraces the standard of the cross ; he kisses it ; he understands the secrets of the Lamb. When, at last, he was led to the cross, and fastened to it, his flesh suffered, but his spirit spoke. He forgot the torture of the Cross, whilst he preached Christ from the Cross ; for the more his body was being stretched on the

wood, the more did his tongue extol Christ, seeing that by thus hanging on the cross, he was honoured with being made a companion of Christ. He suffers not him- self to be loosened from the cross, lest the combat should lose intensity by the delay. The crowd looks upon him, and is in lamentation ; it knows him to be the physi- cian of the soul, and de- mands that he be freed from his chains. It demands that the just man be liberated, lest this crime should de- stroy the people. Mean- while, the Martyr breathes forth his soul, and goes to take possession of the king- dom of the eternal Judge. Grant us, O almighty God, by his merits, that we, being safe and protected from all evils, may for ever give praise and thanks to thee, our Lord, the God of the Martyrs, and the Prince of the Apostles.

The Mozarabic Liturgy is extremely rich in its praises of St. Andrew, both in the Missal and the Breviary : we must limit ourselves to the following beautiful prayer.

The Greek Church is as fervent as any of the Churches of the West in celebrating the prerogatives and merits of St. Andrew. He is the more dear to it, because Constantinople considers him as her patron Apostle. It would, perhaps, be difficult for the Greeks to give any solid proofs of St. Andrew's having founded, as they pretend, the Church of Byzantium ; but this is certain, that Constantinople enjoyed, for many centuries, the possession of the precious treasure of the Saint's Relics. They were translated to that city in the year 357, through the interest of the Emperor Constantius, who placed them in the Basilica of the Apostles built by Con- stantine. Later on, that is, about the middle of the 6th century, Justinian caused them to be translated a second time, but only from one part of that same Basilica to another. We borrow the two following beautiful Hymns from the Menaea of the Greeks; the first is sung in the Evening Office, the second in the Morning Office.

When He, whom the Pre- cursors voice had pro- claimed, the all-holy Word, was made Flesh, and gave us life, and gave the good tidings of salvation to the earth ; then didst thou, most holyAndrew, follow him, and make thyself his first-fruits, and sacrifice, and as it were the first oblation of men : thou didst make him known to thy brother, telling him that this was our God. Pray to Jesus for us, that he save our souls.

When He appeared who clothed himself with our flesh in a virginal yet fruitful womb, and was thus the Son of a Virgin, the teacher of piety, giving us this model of purity ; then wast thou happy, O Andrew, most ardent lover of virtue ; disposing in thy heart to ascend step by step, and wast raised up from glory to the unspeakable glory of the Lord our God. Beseech him, that he save and en- lighten our souls..

Leaving thy fishing of fish, thou catchest men by the rod of thy preaching, throwing to them the bait of virtue, and dragging all nations from the depths of error, O Andrew, the Apostle, brother of the

Leader, most honoured Prince of the earth, excelling and un- failing ! may the venerable remembrance of thee en- lighten them that are in darkness.

Andrew, the Apostle, the first- called of thy disciples, O Lord, and the imitator of thy Passion, and made like to thee, drew out with the hook of thy Cross them that lived and wandered in the sea of ignorance, and then brought them unto thee : therefore do we thy faithful, who have been saved, cry to thee by his prayers, O in- finitely good Lord : grant us peaceful lives, and save our souls.

The Apostle, disciple of Christ, is a fire which inflames men's minds and burns out their sins, penetrating into the very depth of their hearts : and by the mystic rays of his instructions he shines in the d ark hearts of th e Gentiles. Then, too, he burns the wild brambles of pagan f ables,for the fire of the Spirit has such energy ! And is it not a wonder to be trembled at, that a tongue of slime, a nature of clay, a body of dust, should make known the in- tellectual and the immaterial Knowledge1? Do thou, the initiated into unspeakable things, the contemplator of heavenly truths, pray that our minds be illumined.

to obey our Lord with ardour, immediately uniting thyself to him, thou wast set on fire by him, and didst appear as a second light, enlightening with thy rays them that sat in darkness, thus imitating the mercy of Jesus for man. Therefore do we celebrate thy most holy memory, and kiss with great joy the shrine of thy Relics, from which flows health and every sort of boon to thy clients.

By the nets of thy oracles thou didst draw from the abyss of ignorance the nations that knew not God, and gavest them life. Like the splendid courser of the Ruler of the Sea, thou, 0 worthy of all praise, didst stir up the bitter waves by thy wisdom. Thou, the venerable salt of earth, didst season with thy penetrating wisdom what ungodliness was corrupting. This thy wisdom, 0 glorious Apostle, struck dumb with admiration those who had become imbued and puffed up with an unsound wisdom, and ignored the Lord that showed his great mercy to the world.

denter effectus, ipsi imme- diate adhserens, ab ipso ac- census, lumen apparuisti alter um, et degentes in tene- bris tuis illuminasti radiis, hanc homini benignitatem imitatus : unde tuam omni- sanctam perficimus laudem, et Reliquiarum thecam cum gaudio magno deosculamur, ex qua scaturit salus peten- tibus et magna misericordia.

IN THE MOENING OFFICE.

Not by thirst but by love wast thou urged, O Andrew, when thou didst run, as a stag, to the fountain of life. Leaning on faith, thou didst give to drink of the fountains of incorruption to the distant nations that were parched with thirst.

Thou didst feel the law of nature, 0 admirable Andrew, and thou didst take thy bro- ther into partnership, crying out to him : We have found the Desired One! and thus he who was walking in the ways of the flesh, was brought by thee to the knowledge of the Spirit.

When the Word said : Now, folloiv me, Cephas also joyfully followed Christ with Andrew, bidding farewell to father, boat, and nets, and became the citadels of the faith.

The deifying and exhaust- less virtue of the mighty Creator of all things, and of the burning Spirit, dwelt in thee in the form of a fiery tongue ; showing that thou, O divine Andrew, wast a herald of unspeakable things.

Most honoured Andrew ! he bore not weapons of the flesh for his defence, or for the destruction of the for- midable ramparts of the enemy ; but with a breast- plate on him, he led subject to Christ the nations which had been redeemed by Christ from captivity.

Thy ineffable beauty, O Jesus, was first seen by An- drew, who then called out with a loud voice to his bro- ther : Peter, he said, thou man of ardent desires ! we have found the Messias, whom the Law and the Pro- phets have foretold. O come, let us cling to this true life.

As thy reward, 0 Apostle,

Andrew, thou hast regained him whom thou desirest : him, with whom thou didst bind up and worthily garner the sheaves of thy labours. Therefore do we sing to thee our hymns of praise.

Thou desiredst the Master, and thou hast followed him, walking unto life in his foot- steps, and imitating, even unto death, his passion, O verily venerable Andrew !

Calmly sailing the sea of the spiritual life, O Apostle, thou didst cross it with the sails of the Spirit and the faith of Christ. Therefore didst thou enter with joy in- to the port of life for ever.

The spiritual Sun having, by his own will, sunk on the cross, Andrew, that Sim's re- flection, the great and bright light of the Church, wishing also to be dissolved and to set with Him, was hung upon a cross.

As the best of all the dis- ciples of Him, who, of his own will, was fastened to the cross, thou, O blessed Apos- tle, following thy Master even unto death, thou didst ascend with joy to the summit of the Cross, showing us the way that leads to heaven.

Kejoice now, O Bethsaida! for in thee and thy maternal fount bloomed the two most fragrant lilies, Peter and An- drew, bearing, by the grace of Christ, whom they resem- bled in his passion, the odour of the preaching of the faith to the whole world.

The Church of Constantinople, so devoted, as we have seen, to the glory of St. Andrew, was at length deprived of the precious treasure of his Relics. This happened in the year 1210, when the City was taken by the Crusaders. Cardinal Peter of Capua, the Legate of the Holy See, translated the body of St. Andrew into the Cathedral of Amalfi, a town in the Kingdom of Naples, where it remains to this day, the glorious instrument of numberless miracles, and the object of the devout veneration of the people. It is well known how, at the same period, the most precious Relics of the Greek Church came, by a visi- ble judgment of God, into the possession of the Latins. Byzantium refused to accept those terrible warnings, and continued obstinate in her schism. She was still in possession of the Head of the holy Apostle, owing, no doubt, to this circumstance, that in the several Translations which had been made, it had been kept in a separate reliquary by itself. When the Byzantine Empire was destroyed by the Turks, Divine Providence so arranged events, as that the Church of Rome should be enriched with this magnificent Relic. In 1462, the Head of St. Andrew was, therefore, brought thither by the celebrated Cardinal Bessarion ; and on the twelfth of April of that same year, Palm Sunday, the heroic Pope Pius II. went in great pomp to meet it as far as the Bridge Milvius (Ponte Molle), and then placed it in the Basilica of St. Peter, on the Vatican, where it is

at present, near the Confession of the Prince of the Apostles. At the sight of this venerable Head, Pius II. was transported with a religious enthusiasm, and before taking up the glorious Relic in order to carry it into Rome, he pronounced the magnificent address which we now give, as a conclusion to the liturgical praises given by the several Churches to St. Andrew.

" At length, thou hast arrived, O most holy and " venerable Head of the saintly Apostle ! The fury " of the Turks has driven thee from thy resting-place, " and thou art come as an exile to thy Brother, the " Prince of the Apostles. No, thy Brother will not " fail thee ; and by the will of God, the day shall " come when men shall say in thy praise : 0 happy " banishment, which caused thee to receive such a " welcome ! Meanwhile, here shalt thou dwell with " thy Brother, and share in his honours.

" This is Rome, the venerable City, which was de- " dicated by thy Brother's precious blood. The peo- " pie thou seest, are they whom the blessed Apostle, " thy most loving Brother, and St. Paul, the Vessel " of Election, regenerated unto Christ our Lord. " Thus the Romans are thy kinsmen. They vene- " rate, and honour, and love thee as their Father's " Brother ; nay, as their second Father ; and are con- " fident of thy patronage in the presence of the great "God.

"' 0 most blessed Apostle Andrew ! thou preacher " of the truth, and defender of the dogma of the " most Holy Trinity ! with what joy dost thou not " fill us on this day, whereon it is given us to behold " thy sacred and venerable Head, which deserved that, " on the day of Pentecost, the Holy Paraclete should " rest upon it in the form of fire !

" O ye Christians that visit Jerusalem out of re- ference for your Saviour, that there ye may see the " places where his feet have stood ; lo ! here is the

"throne of the Holy Ghost. Here sat the Spirit of " the Lord. Here was seen the Third Person of the "Trinity. Here were the eyes that so often saw "Jesus in the flesh. This was the mouth that so " often spake to Jesus ; and on these cheeks did that " same Lord doubtless impress his sacred kisses.

" O wondrous Sanctuary, wherein dwelt charity, " and kindness, and gentleness, and spiritual con- " solation. Who could look upon such venerable " and precious Relics of the Apostle of Christ, and " not be moved ? and not be filled with tender de- " votion ? and not shed tears for very joy ? Yea, O " most admirable Apostle Andrew ! we rejoice, and " are glad, and exult, at this thy coming, for we "doubt not but what thou tlryself art present here, " and bearest us company as we enter with thy Head " into the Holy City.

" The Turks are indeed our enemies, as being the " enemies of the Christian Religion ; but in that " they have been the occasion of thy coming amongst " us, we are grateful to them. For, what greater " blessing could have befallen us, than that we should " be permitted to see thy most sacred Head, and " that our Rome should be filled with its fragrance ? " Oh ! that we could welcome thee with the honours " which are due to thee, and receive thee in a way " becoming thy exceeding holiness ! But, accept our " good will, and our sincere desire to honour thee, " and suffer us now to touch thy Relics with our un- " worthy hands, and, though sinners, to accompany " thee into the walls of the City.

" Enter, then, the Holy City, and show thy love " to her people. May thy coming be a boon to " Christendom. May thy entrance be peaceful, and " thy abode amongst us bring happiness and pros- " perity. Be thou our advocate in heaven, and, " together with blessed Apostles Peter and Paul, " defend this City, and protect, with thy love, all

NOV. 30. ST. ANDREW, APOSTLE. 305

" Christian people ; that, by thy intercession, the " mercy of God may be upon us, and if his indignation " be enkindled against us by reason of our manifold " sins, let it fall upon the impious Turks and the pa- " gan nations that blaspheme our Lord Jesus Christ. " Amen."

Thus has the glory of St. Andrew been blended, in Rome, with that of St. Peter. But the Apostle of the Cross, whose feast was heretofore kept, in many Churches, with an Octave, has also been chosen as Patron of one of the Kingdoms of the West. Scot- land, when she was a Catholic country, had put herself under his protection. May he still exercise his protection over her, and, by his prayers, hasten her return to the true faith !

Let us now, in union with the Church, pray to this holy Apostle, for this is the glorious day of his feast : let us pay him that honour which is due to him, and ask him for the help of which we stand in need.

We have scarce begun our mystic journey of Advent, seeking our divine Saviour Jesus, when lo ! God grants us to meet thee, O blessed Andrew, at our very first step. When Jesus, our Messias, began his public life, thou hadst already become the obedient disciple of his Precursor, who preached his Coming : thou wast among the first of them who received the Son of Mary as the Messias foretold in the Law and the Prophets. But thou couldst not keep the heavenly secret from him who was so dear to thee ; to Peter, then, thou didst bear the Good Tidings, and didst lead him to Jesus.

O blessed Apostle ! we also are louging for the Messias, the Saviour of our souls ; since thou hast found him, lead us also unto him. We place under thy protection this holy period of expectation and preparation, which is to bring us to the day of our Saviour's Nativity, that divine Mystery in which he

will manifest himself to the world. Assist us to render ourselves worthy of seeing him on that great night. The baptism of Penance prepared thee for receiving the grace of knowing the Word of life ; pray for us that we may become truly penitent and may purify our hearts, during this holy time, and thus be able to behold Him, who has said : Blessed are the clean of heart, for they shall see God.

Thou hast a special power of leading souls to Jesus, O glorious Saint ! for even he, who was to be made the Pastor of the whole flock, was presented to the Messias by thee. By calling thee to himself on this day, our Lord has given thee as the Patron of Christians who, each year, at this season, are seeking that God in whom thou art now living : they must begin it with praying to thee to show them the way which leads to Jesus.

Thou teachest us this way ; it is that of fidelity, of fidelity even to the Cross. In that way thou didst courageously walk : and because the Cross leads to Jesus Christ, thou didst passionately love the Cross. Pray for us, O holy Apostle ! that we may begin to understand this love of the Cross ; and that having understood it, we may put it in practice. Thy brother says to us in his Epistle : Christ having suffered in the flesh, be you also armed with the same thought.1 Thy feast, O blessed Andrew ! shows us thee as the living commentary of this doctrine. Because thy Master was crucified, thou would st also be crucified. From the high throne to which thou hast been raised by the Cross, pray for us, that the Cross may be unto us the expiation of the sins which are upon us, the quenching of the passions which burn within us, and the means of uniting us by love to Him, who, through love alone for us, was nailed to the Cross.

Important, indeed, and precious are these lessons

1 I. St. Pet. iv. l.

NOV. 30. ST. ANDREW, APOSTLE. 307

of the Cross ; but the Cross, O blessed Apostle, is the perfection and the consummation, and not the first commencement. It is the Infant God, it is the God of the Crib that we must first know and love ; it was the Lamb of God that St. John pointed out to thee ; and it is that Lamb whom we so ardently desire to contemplate. The austere and awful time of Jesus' Passion is not come ; we are now in Advent. Fortify us for the day of combat; but the grace we now most need, is compunction and tender love. We put under thy patronage this great work of our prepara- tion for the Coming of Jesus into our hearts.

Remember also, O blessed Andrew, the holy Church, of which thou wast a pillar, and which thou hast beautified by the shedding of thy blood : lift up thy hands for her to Him, whose battle she is for ever fighting. Pray that the Cross she has to bear in this her pilgrimage, may be lightened ; that she may love this Cross, and that it may be the source of her power and her glory. Remember with especial love the holy Roman Church, the Mother and Mistress of all Churches ; and by reason of that fervent love she has for thee, obtain for her victory and peace by the Cross. Visit anew, in thy Apostolic zeal, the Church of Constantinople, which has for- feited true light and unity, because she would not render homage to Peter, thy brother, whom thou honouredst as thy Chief, out of love to Him who is the common Master of both him and thee. And lastly, pray for Scotland, that has dishonoured thy protection for these three past ages ; obtain for her that the days of her rebellion from the faith may be shortened, and, with the rest of our Isle of Saints, soon return to the fold of the One Shepherd.

We will close this day with a prayer to the Saviour, whom we are expecting ; and celebrate, by this ancient and venerable Hymn, the mystery of his Coming.

ADVENT,

HYMN FOE THE TIME OF ADVENT.

{The Mozarabic Breviary : in the Hymnarium.)

Gaudete, flores Martyrum ! Salvete, plebes gentium, Visum per astra mittite, Sperate signum glorise.

Voces Prophetarum sonant, Venire Jesum nuntiant, Kedemptionis prsevia Qua3 nos redemit gratia.

Hie mane nostrum pro- micat. Et corda lseta exaestuant, Cum vox fidelis personat Praenuntiatrix gloriam.

Tantae salutis gaudium, Quo est redemptum saecu-

lum, Exceptionis inclytum Abhinc ciamus canticum.

Adventus hie primus fuit, Punire quo non saeculi Venit, sed ulcus tergere, Salvando quod perierat.

At hunc secundus praemo- net, Adesse Christum januis Sanctis coronas reddere, Ccelique regna pandere.

iEterna lux promittitur, Sidusque salvans promitur ; Jam nos jubar praefulgidum Ad jus vocat ccelestium.

Te, Christe, solum quaeri- mus

Rejoice, ye Flowers of the Martyrs ! Hail, all ye people and nations ! lift up your eyes to heaven, and await the sign of glory.

The voice of the Prophets is heard, announcing the coming of Jesus ; it is the harbinger of our Redemp- tion, of the grace which saved us.

How bright is our morn, and how do our hearts swell with joy, when the faithful voice comes heralding in our glory !

May the joy of so great a salvation, whereby the world is redeemed, inspire us with a solemn canticle in praise of Jesus' coming.

It was his first : and he came not to punish, but to heal the sores and sins of the world, saving his creature that was lost.

But when the second Advent comes, it will tell the world that Christ is at its very doors, to give the Saints their crowns, and throw open the kingdom of heaven.

We have a promise of eternal light ; the star of our salvation is rising ; and even now its splendid rays are calling us to our right to heaven.

Thee alone, 0 Jesus, do we seek, and wish to see

NOV. 30. ST. ANDREW, APOSTLE.

309

thee as thou art, God. Happy vision, which will put us out of all reach of hell.

That thus, when thou comest, O Redeemer, sur- rounded by the white- robed army of Martyrs, thoumayest admit us also into their pure company.

To God the Father, and to his Only Son, and to the Holy Paraclete, be glory both now and for ever. Amen.

Videre sicut es Deus, Ut lseta nos hasc visio Evellat omni tartaro.

Quo dum Redemptor ve- neris, Cum candidato Martyrum Globo adunes ccelibi Nos tunc beato ccetui.

Deo Patri sit gloria, Ejusque soli Filio, Cum Spiritu Paraclito, Et nunc et in perpetuum.

310 ADVENT.

FIRST DAY OF DECEMBER.

The Church of Rome does not keep this day as a feast of any Saint ; she simply recites the Office of the Feria, unless it happen that the first Sunday of Advent fall on this first day of the month, in which case, the Office of that Sunday is celebrated, as given above in the Proper of the Time.

But should this first day of December be a simple Feria of Advent, we shall do well to begin at once our considerations upon the preparations which were made for the merciful Coming of the Saviour of the world.

Four thousand years of expectation preceded that Coming, and they are expressed by the four weeks of Advent, which we must spend before we come to the glorious festivity of our Lord's Nativity. Let us reflect upon the holy impatience of the Saints of the Old Testament, and how they handed down, from age to age, the grand hope, which was to be but hope to them, since they were not to see it realised. Let us follow, in thought, the long succession of the witnesses of the promise : Adam, and the first Patri- archs, who lived before the deluge; then, Noah, Abraham, Isaac, Jacob, and the twelve Patriarchs of the Hebrew people ; then Moses, Samuel, David, and Solomon; then, the Prophets and the Macha- bees ; and, at last, John the Baptist and his disciples. These are the holy ancestors, of whom the book of Ecclesiasticus speaks,where it says : Let us praise men of renown, and our fathers in their generation ;x and of whom the Apostle thus speaks to the Hebrews : All these being approved by the testimony of faith,

3 Eccles. xliv. 1.

DECEMBER FIRST. 311

received not the promise ; God providing some better thing for us, that they should not be perfected with- out us : their faith was tried and approved, and yet they received not the object of the promises made to them. It was for us that God had reserved the stu- pendous gift, and therefore did not permit them to attain the object of their desires.1

Let us honour them for their faith ; let us honour them as our veritable fathers, since it was in reward of their faith, that our Lord remembered and fulfilled his merciful promise ; let us honour them, too, as the ancestors of the Messias in the flesh. We may imagine each of them saying, as he lay on his dying bed, this solemn prayer to him who alone could conquer death : I will look for thy Salvation, 0 Lord ! It was the exclamation of Jacob, at his last hour, when he was pronouncing his prophetic bless- ings on his children : and then, says the Scripture, he drew up his feet upon his bed, and died, and he was gathered unto his people.2

Thus did all these holy men, in quitting this life, go to await, far from the abode of eternal light, Him who was to come in due time, and re-open the gate of heaven. Let us contemplate them in this place of expectation, and give our grateful thanks to God, who has brought us to his admirable Light, without requiring us to pass through a Limbo of darkness. It is our duty to pray ardently for the Coming of the Deliverer, who will break down, by his Cross, the gates of the prison, and will fill it with the bright- ness of his glory. During this holy season, the Church is continually borrowing the fervent expres- sions of these Fathers of the Christian people, making them her own prayer for the Messias to come. Let us turn to those great Saints, and beg of them to pray, that our work of preparation for Jesus' coming to our hearts, may be blessed by God. 1 Heb. xi. 39, 40. 2 Gen. xlix. 32.

ADVENT.

We will make use, for this end, of the beautiful hymn wherein the Greek Church celebrates the me- mory of all the Saints of the Old Testament, on the Sunday immediately preceding the Feast of Christ- mas.

HYMN FOR THE FEAST OF THE HOLY FATHERS.

{Taken from the Mencea of the Greeks.)

Avorum hodie, Fideles, perficientes memorias, re- hymnificemus Christum Re- demptorem, qui illos magni- ficavit in omnibus gentibus, et qui incredibilia in eis per fidem operatus est ; Domi- num, utpote fortem et po tentem ; et ex illis manifes- tavit virgam potentiae nobis, unicam virum nescientem et Deiparam, Mariam castam, ex qua flos prodiit. Christus germinans omnibus vitain, et salutem aeternani.

Tu es qui sanctos pueros ex igne liberasti, Domine, et ex ore leonum Daniel ; qui Abraham benedixisti, et Isaac servum tuum, et filium ejus Jacob, qui dignatus es ex illorum semine nasci apud nos ut prius lapsos salvares proavos nostros, crucifigi autem et sepeliri : et rupisti mortis vincula, et consur- gere facis omnes qui a seculo inter mortuos erant, adoran- tes tuum, Christe, regnum aeternum.

Adam primum veneremur, manu honoratum Creatoris

Celebrating, O ye faithful, on this day, the memory of the ancient Fathers, let us sing a new hymn to our Redeemer Christ, who magnified them in all nations, and worked incredible things in them by faith, for he is "the strong and mighty Lord. By them did he manifest to us the sceptre of his power, the un- paralleled Virgin-Mother of God, the chaste Mary, from whom came the Flower that buds forth life and eternal salvation to all, Christ.

It was thou, O Lord, that didst deliver the holy Chil- dren from the furnace, and Daniel from the mouth of the lions ; that didst bless Abraham, and Isaac thy ser- vant, and Jacob his son ; that didst vouchsafe to be born among us from their seed, so to save our first parents who had fallen, and to be crucified and buried ; that didst break the bonds of death, and gavest resurrec- tion to all them who had died from the beginning, and who adored, O Christ, thy eternal kingdom.

And first let us venerate Adam, who was honoured by

the Creator's hand, and was the first father of us all : who now dwells in the heavenly- tabernacles, and rests amidst the holy elect.

The God and the Lord of all things received Abel, who offered his gifts with a gene- rous heart ; and took him into the heavenly light as a divine Martyr, when he was slain by the murderer's hand.

Seth is celebrated through- out the world for his ardour towards the Creator : who saved him for his irreproach- able life and this holy dis- position of mind ; and now, in the region of the living, he sings : Holy art thou, O Lord !

Enos, prophetically called the admirable, for his words and voice and heart, hoped in spirit in the Lord of all, and after a life spent on earth in exceeding goodness, he departed full of glory.

Let us praise, in our sacred canticles and prayers, the blessed Henoch ; who, when he had pleased God, was translated to glory, and, as became so faithful a servant of God, without being over- come by death, as it is writ- ten of him.

Let us give praise to God by celebrating, with our hymns, Noah, who was just : in all things, God honoured him with his divine com- mands, and he was well- pleasing to Christ, to whom let us sing with faith : Glory be to thy power, 0 Lord !

et omnium nostrum proa- yum, jam nunc habitantem in ccelestibus tabernaculis, inter sanctos electos quies- centem.

Abel dona proferentem mente generosa, admisit om- nium Deus et Dominus ; eumque homicida olim manu peremptum, in altum recepit ad lumen, ut divinum Mar- tyrem.

Canitur in mundo Seth pro suo erga Creatorem ar- dore : nam in irreprehensibili vitae ratione et animse dis- positione ilium vere sanavit ; et in regione vivorum cla- mat : Sanctus es, Domine.

Ore et lingua et corde Enos admirabilis cognominatus prophetice, in omnium Do- niinum speravit in spiritu, et optime vita in terns acta, gloriosus decessit.

Sacris eloquiis et orationi- bus Henoch beatum prsedice- mus ; qui, cum Deo placu- isset, translatus est in glo- riam, visus, ut fertur, mor- tem superasse, sicut Dei servus fidelissimus.

Laudem proferamus Deo, honorantes melodiis Noe, qui fuit Justus : in omnibus enim divinis mandatis orna- tus, visus est Christo bene- placitus ; cui canamus cum fide : Gloria virtuti tuse, Do- mine.

ADVENT.

Videns tuam Deus nobi- lem indoleru et mentis tua? sinceritatem, et te in omni- bus, Noe, perfectum, secundi mundi ducem te signat, sal- vantem ex omni gen ere con- tra diluvium, sensibile se- men, ut ipse mandaverat.

Noe, Dei legem incorrup- tam servantem, justumque inventum in generatione sua, et qui lignea salvavit olim in area irrationabilia genera, or- dinatione omnimoda, beatum piis prsedicemus hyninis.

Vinum compunctionis nobis scaturire facit honorantibus te, Noe beate, memoria tua, lsetificans et amnias et corda undique beatificantium sin- cere mores tuos honestos, et divinam agendi rationem.

Laudibus honoretur Sem, qui fructifieare fecit pater- nam benedictionem, et ante Deum placidus demonstra- te, et proavorum clioris ad- scriptus, et in regione vivo- rum lastantissiine requies- cens.

Yidere meruit, tamquam Dei amicus, Abraham diem Creatoris sui, plenus factus lsetitiee paternse : liunc ergo recto corde honorantes, bea- tum dicamus omnes, ut Dei fidelem servum.

Vidisti, ut homini videre fas est, Trinitatem, et illam hospitatus es : unde merce- dem recepisti hospitalitatis,

God seeing thy noble heart, and the sincerity of thy mind, and how in all things thou wast perfect, O Noah, he makes thee the Father of the second world, and bids thee save from the deluge a rem- nant of every species of ani- mal.

Let us in our holy hymns praise Noah, who kept the law of God without reproof, and was found just in his generation, and who, by an admirable arrangement, saved, in the wooden ark, all the brute creation.

Thy memory, O blessed Noah, fills us with the wine of compunction, which glad- dens our souls and hearts, whilst we devoutly extol thy holy life and thy divine man- ner of acting.

Sem is worthy of our praise, who brought forth plentiful fruit from his father's blessing, and by his meekness found favour with God, and was numbered in the choir of the Fathers, and now rests in perfect joy in the land of the living.

Abraham merited, as the friend of God, to see the day of his Creator, and was filled with the joy promised to the Fathers : him, therefore, let us honour with sincere devo- tion, and let us all proclaim him the blessed Abraham, God's faithful servant.

Thou didst see, as far as it is permitted man to see, the Trinity, and thou didst make it thy guest : wherefore thou

receivedst the reward of thy hospitality, and wast made the Father, in the faith, of countless nations.

Most blessed Isaac, the divine wisdom made thee the type of Jesns in his Pas- sion, when thy fathers sub- lime faith led thee to the sacrifice : therefore art thou blest, and loved of God as a most faithful friend, and seated on a throne with all the just.

Of all the servants of God Jacob was the most faithful : therefore was it that he wrestled with the Angel, seeing God in spirit, and his name was changed ; and as he slept, he beheld the divine ladder, on which God was leaning ; it was God, assum- ing to himself, in his mercy, human flesh.

Joseph, when he lovingly obeyed his father, was let down into a well and sold, and was the prototype of Him that was sacrificed, and thrown down into a pit. He gave corn to Egypt and saved it ; he was wise and just, and a most true king over his passions.

Job lawfully endured the combat of ceaseless tempta- tions, and deserves to be praised ; he was God's most true servant, he was meek, and a man without guile, upright, perfect, without re- proof, ever saying : Blessed art thou, O God !

Let us faithfully honour Moses, and Aaron, and Hor :

factus immensarum gentium in fide pater.

Typus Christi passionis factus es sapienter, Isaac beatissime, patris bona fide ad immolandum adducte : ideoque beatus effectus es et amicus Dei visus es fidelissi- mus, et cum omnibus justis sedem consecutus es.

Visus est Jacob omnium Dei servorum fidelissimus : ideoque pugnavit cum An- gelo, in mente videns Deum, et nomen mutavit, dormi- ensque divinam contemplatus est scalam, cui insidebat Deus, carni in bonitate sua adherens.

Patris obedientiam cum amore amplectens Joseph in puteum demissus, tamquam illius prototypus venditur qui immolatus est, et in pu- teum demissus est Christus ; et iEgypto frumenta distri- buens monstratus est, sa- piens et Justus effectus, rex- que concupiscentiarum ve- rissimus.

let us commemorate Josue, and the most holy Levi, and Gedeon, and Samson ; and let us sing : Blessed art thou, O God of our Fathers ! Let us celebrate the memory of that group of Fathers so loved of God, Baruch and Nathan and Eleazar ; Josias, David, Jephte, and Samuel who had the vision of what had passed, and cried out : Let every creature bless the Lord!

Let our melodies praise God's Prophets, celebrating Osee, Micheas, Sophonias, Habacuc, Zacharias, Jonas, Aggeus, Amos, Abdias, Ma- lachias, Nahum, Isaias, Jere- mias, Ezechiel, Daniel, Elias, and Eliseus.

December 2. SAINT BIBIANA, VIRGIN AND MARTYR.

Or the Saints, whose feasts are kept during Advent, five are Virgins. The first, St. Bibiana, whom we honour to-day, is a daughter of Rome ; the second, St. Barbara, is the glory of the Eastern Churches ; the third, St. Eulalia of Merida, is one of Spain's richest treasures ; the fourth, St. Lucy, belongs to beautiful Sicily ; the fifth, St. Odila, is claimed by France. These five wise Virgins lighted their lamps and watched, waiting for the coming of the Spouse. Such was their constancy and fidelity, that four of them shed their blood for the love of Him, after whom they longed. Let us take courage by this noble example ; and since we have not, as the Apostle expresses it, as yet resisted unto blood, let us not think it hard if we suffer fatigue and trouble in the holy exercises of this penitential season of Advent : He, for whom we do them all, will soon be with us and repay us. To-day, it is the chaste and courageous Bibiana, who instructs us by her glorious example.

Bibiana, Virgo Roman a, Bibiana was a Roman Vir-

the mark of slavery, he was banished to Aquae Taurinae, and there died a martyr. Her mother, Dafrosa, was first shut up in her own house with her daughters, that she might die by starvation ; but shortly afterwards was ba- nished from Rome and be- headed. The virtuous parents thus put to death, Bibiana was deprived of all her posses- sions, as also was her sister, Demetria. Apronianus, the City Praetor, thirsting after their wealth, persecutes the two sisters. They are bereaved of every human help. But God, who gives food to them that are in hunger, wonder- fully nourishes them ; and the Praetor is exceedingly as- tonished on finding them in better health and strength than before.

Apronianus, notwithstand- ing, endeavours to induce them to venerate the gods of the Gentiles. If they consent, he promises them the reco- very of all their wealth, the Emperor's favour, and mar- riage to the noblest in the empire : but should they re- fuse, he threatens them with prison, and scourgings, and the sword. But neither pro- mises nor threats can make them abandon the true faith ; they would rather die, than be defiled by the idolatrous practices of paganism ; and they resolutely resist the im- pious Praetor. Whereupon, Demetria was struck down in the presence of Bibiana, and slept in the Lord. Bibiana

But the virgin, taught from her infancy to observe the Christian law, and to preserve with the ut- most jealousy the flower of her virginity, rose above na- ture, defeated all the artifices of the wretched Bufina, and foiled the craft of the Prsetor. Finding, therefore, that Pvufina could in no wise shake the virgin's holy resolution, and that both her wicked words and frequent blows were of no avail ; and seeing his hopes disappointed and his labour thrown away ; the Praetor became violently en- raged, and ordered Bibiana to be stripped by the lictors, to be fastened to a pillar with her hands bound, and to be beaten to death with leaded whips. Her sacred body was left for two days in the Bull-Forum, as food for dogs ; but received no in- jury, being divinely pre- served. A priest called John then buried it during the night, close to the grave of her sister and mother, near the Palace Licinius, where there stands at this day a Church consecrated to God under the title of St. Bibiana. Urban VIII. restored this Church, having there dis- covered the bodies of Saints Bibiana, Demetria, and Da- frosa, which he placed under the high altar.

DEC. 2. ST. BIBIANA. 321

Holy Bibiana, most wise Virgin ! thou hast gone through the long unbroken watch of this life ; and when, suddenly, the Spouse came, thy lamp was bright and richly fed with oil. Now thou art dwel- ling in the abode of the eternal marriage-feast, where the Beloved feeds among the lilies. Remember us who are still living in the expectation of that same divine Spouse, whose eternal embrace is secured to thee for ever. We are awaiting the Birth of the Saviour of the world, which is to be the end of sin and the beginning of justice ; we are awaiting the coming of this Saviour into our souls that he may give them life and union with himself by love ; we are awaiting our Judge, the Judge of the living and the dead. Most wise Virgin ! intercede for us, by thy fervent prayers, with this our Saviour, our Spouse, and our Judge; pray that each of these three visits may work and perfect in us that divine union, for which we have all been created. Pray also, O faithful Virgin, for the Church on earth, which gave thee to the Church in heaven, and which so devoutly watches over thy precious remains. Obtain for her that strict fidelity, which will ever render her worthy of Him, who is her Spouse as he is thine. Though he has enriched her with the most magnificent gifts, and given her confidence by his promises which cannot fail, yet does he wish her to ask, and us to ask for her, the graces which will lead her to the glorious destiny which awaits her.

We will to-day consider the state of nature at this season of the year. The earth is stripped of her wonted verdure, the flowers are gone, the fruits are fallen, the leaves are torn from the trees and scattered by the wind, and every living thing stiffens with the cold. It seems as though the hand of death had touched creation. We see the sun rise after the

long night of his absence ; and scarce have we felt his warmth at noon, than he sets again, and leaves us in the chilly darkness. Each day he shortens his visit. Is the world to become sunless, and men to live out the rest of life in gloom ? The old pagans, who witnessed this struggle between light and dark- ness, and feared the sun was going to leave them, dedicated the twenty-fifth day of December, which was the winter solstice, to the worship of the sun. After this day, their hopes revived, in seeing the glorious luminary again mounting up in the sky, and gradually regaining his triumphant position.

We Christians can have no such feelings as these ; our light is the true faith, which tells us that there is a Sun to be sought for which never sets, and is never eclipsed. Having Him, we care little for the absence of any other brightness ; nay, all other light, without Him, can only lead us astray. O Jesus ! thou true light, that enlightenest every man coming into this world ! thou didst choose, for thy birth among us, a time of the year which forces us to reflect upon the miserable state of the world when thou didst come to save it. " The evening was " coming on, and the day wTas far spent," says St. Bernard : " the Sun of Justice had all but set, so " that exceeding scanty was his light or warmth on " earth : for the light of divine knowledge was very '( faint, and, sin abounding, the heat of charity had " grown cold. There was neither Angel to visit men, " nor Prophet to speak to them ; both seemed in " despair, for the hardness and obstinacy of man had " made every effort useless : then I said, they are " the wTords of our Redeemer, then I said, lo I I " come i"1 O Jesus !

heart, without thy divine heat. Open thou the eyes of our faith ; that whilst seeing with the eyes of the body the gradual decrease of the material light, we may think of that other darkness, which is in the soul that has not thee. Then, indeed, will the cry, which comes from the depths of our misery, make its way to thee, and thou wilt come on the day thou hast fixed, dispelling every shadow of darkness by thy irresistible brightness.

PRAYER FOR THE TIME OF ADVENT.

{The Mozarabic Breviary, Wednesday of the Second Week of Advent, Capitula.)

0 Lord, Jesus Christ, who having assumed human nature, and becoming the Saviour of the human race, wast given as a light to the nations ; open the eyes of the hearts of them that believe in thee, and merci- fully set free from their prison them that are bound in the fetters of unbelief ; and whom thou seest cap- tives in prison in the dark- ness of ignorance, enlighten them, we beseech thee, by the splendour of the know- ledge of thee.

Domine, Jesu Christe, qui assumpto homine, hominum susceptor effectus, in lucem gentium clatus es ; aperi oculos cordium in te creden- tium populorum, atque ab- strahe misericors de conclu- sione religatos adhuc vincu- lis diffidentiae : et quos in domo carceris detineri con- spicis in tenebris ignorantiae, tuae quassumus scientiae irradies splendore.

324 ADVENT.

December 3. SAINT FRANCIS XAVIER, CONFESSOR,

APOSTLE OF THE INDIES.

The Apostles being the heralds of the Coming of the Messias, it was fitting that Advent should have, in its calendar, the name of some one among them. Divine Providence has provided for this ; for, to say- nothing of St. Andrew, whose feast is oftentimes past before the season of Advent has commenced, St. Thomas' day is unfailingly kept immediately before Christmas. We will explain, later on, why St. Thomas holds that position rather than any other Apostle ; at present, we simply assert the fitness of there being at least one of the Apostolic College, who should announce to us, in this period of the Catholic cycle, the Coming of the Redeemer. But God has not wished that the first Apostolate should be the only one to appear on the first page of the liturgical calendar; great also, though in a lesser degree, is the glory of that second Apostolate, whereby the Spouse of Jesus Christ multiplies her children, even in her fruitful old age, as the Psalmist expresses it.1 There are Gentiles who have still to be evangelised ; the Coming of the Messias is far from having been announced to all nations. Now, of all the valiant messengers of the divine Word

1 Ps. xci. 15.

DEC. 3. ST. FKANCIS XAVIER. 325

who have, during the last few hundred years, pro- claimed the good tidings among infidel nations, there is not one whose glory is greater, who has worked greater wonders, or who has shown himself a closer imitator of the first Apostles, than the modern Apostle of the Indies, St. Francis Xavier.

Yes, the life and apostolate of this wonderful man were a great triumph for our Mother the holy Catholic Church ; for St. Francis came just at the period when heresy, encouraged by false learning, by political intrigues, by covetousness, and by all the wicked passions of the human heart, seemed on the eve of victory. Emboldened by all these, this enemy of God spoke, with the deepest contempt, of that ancient Church which rested on the promises of Jesus Christ; it declared that she was unworthy of the confidence of men, and dared even to call her the harlot of Babylon, as though the vices of her children could taint the purity of the Mother. God's time came at last, and he showed himself in his power : the garden of the Church suddenly appeared rich in the most admirable fruits of sanctity. Heroes and heroines issued from that apparent barrenness ; and whilst the pretended Reformers showed them- selves to be the wickedest of men, two single coun- tries,— Italy and Spain, — gave to the world the most magnificent Saints.

One of these is brought before us to-day, claiming our love and our praise. The Calendar of the Liturgical Year will present to us, from time to time, his cotemporaries and his companions in divine grace and heroic sanctity. The sixteenth century is, therefore, worthy of comparison with any other age of the Church. The so-called Reformers of those times gave little proof of their desire to convert infidel countries, when their only zeal was to bury Christianity beneath the ruin of her churches. But at that very time, a society of Apostles was

326 ADVENT.

offering itself to the Roman Pontiff, that he might send them to plant the true faith among people who "were sitting in the thickest shades of death. But, we repeat, not one of these holy men so closely imitated the first Apostles as did Francis, the disciple of Ignatius. He had all the marks and labours of an Apostle : an immense world of people evangelised by his zeal, hundreds of thousands of infidels baptised by his indefatigable ministration, and miracles of every kind, which proved him, to the infidel, to be marked with the sign, which they received, who, living in the flesh, planted the Church, as the Church speaks in her Liturgy. So that, in the six- teenth century, the East received from the ever holy city of Rome, an Apostle, who, by his character and his works, resembled those earlier ones sent her by Jesus himself. May our Lord Jesus be for ever praised for having vindicated the honour of the Church, his Spouse, by raising up Francis Xavier, and giving to men, in this his servant, a representa- tion of what the first Apostles were, whom he sent to preach the Gospel when the whole world was pagan.

Let us now read the short account given us, in the words of the Church, of this new Apostle.

lights by his severe mortifi- cations of the body ; for he never allowed himself either flesh meat, or wine, or even wheaten bread, and ate only the coarsest food ; he not un- frequently abstained, for the space of two or three days, from every sort of nourish- ment. He scourged himself so severely with disciplines, to which were fastened pieces of iron, as to be frequently covered with blood. His sleep, which he took on the ground, was extremely short.

Such austerity and holiness of life had fitted him for the labours of an Apostle ; so that when John the Third, King of Portugal, asked of Paul the Third, that some of the newly- founded Society might be sent to the Indies, that Pontiff, by the advice of St. Ignatius, selected Francis for so impor- tant a work, and gave him the powers of Apostolic Nun- cio. Having reached those parts, he was found to be, on a sudden, divinely gifted with the knowledge of the exceed- ingly difficult and varied lan- guages of the several coun- tries. It sometimes even happened, that whilst he was preaching in one language to the people of several nations, each heard him speaking in their own tongue. He tra- velled over innumerable pro- vinces, always on foot, and not unfrequently bare footed. He carried the faith into Japan, and six other coun-

tries. He converted to Christ many hundred thousands in the Indies, and baptised se- veral Princes and Kings. And yet, though he was doing such great things for God, he was so humble, that he never wrote to St, Ignatius, the then General of the Society, but on his knees.

God blessed this zeal for the diffusion of the Gospel by many and extraordinary miracles. The Saint restored sight to a blind man. By the sign of the cross he changed sea-water into fresh, suffi- cient, for many days, for a crew of live hundred men, who were dying from thirst. This water was afterwards taken into several countries, and being given to sick peo- ple, they were instantly cured. He raised several dead men to life; one of these had been buried on the pre- vious day, so that the corpse had to be taken out of the grave ; two others were being carried to the grave, when the Saint took them by the hand, and, raising them from the bier, restored them to their parents. Being con- tinually gifted with the spirit of prophecy, he fore- told many future events, or such as were happening in most distant parts. At length, full of merit, and worn out by his labours, he died on the second day of December, in Sancian, an island off the coast of China. His corpse was twice buried

At length, fresh and extraordi- nary miracles being every- where wrought through the intercession of the man of God, he was enrolled among the Saints by Gregory the Fifteenth.

Glorious Apostle of Jesus Christ, who didst impart bis divine light to the nations that were sitting in the shadows of death ! we, though unworthy of the name of Christians, address our prayers to thee, that, by the charity which led thee to sacrifice everything for the conversion of souls, thou wouldst deign to prepare us for the visit of the Saviour, whom our faith and our love desire. Thou wast the father of infidel nations; be the protector, during this holy season, of them that believe in Christ. Before thy eyes had contemplated the Lord Jesus, thou didst make him known to countless people ; now that thou seest him face to face, obtain for us that, when he is come, we may see him with that simple and ardent faith of the Magi, those glorious first-fruits of the nations to which thou didst bear the admirable light.1

Remember also, O great Apostle, those nations which thou didst evangelise, and where now, by a terrible judgment of God, the word of life has ceased to bring forth fruit. Pray for the vast empire of China, on which thou didst look when dying, but which was not blessed with thy preaching. Pray for Japan, thy dear garden which has been laid waste by

the savage wild beast, of which the Psalmist speaks. May the blood of the Martyrs, which was poured out on that land like water, bring it the long expected fertility. Bless, too, all the Missions, which our holy Mother the Church has undertaken in those lands where the Cross has not yet triumphed. May the heart of the infidel be opened to the grand simpli- city and light of faith ; may the seed bring forth fruit a hundred-fold ; may the number of thy succes- sors in the new apostolate ever increase ; may their zeal and charity fail not ; may their toil receive its reward of abundant fruit; and may the crown of mar- tyrdom,which they receive, be not only the recompense, but the perfection and the triumph of their apostolic ministry. Recommend to our Lord the innumerable members of that Association, which is the means of the Faith beiDg propagated through the world, and which has thee for its Patron. Pray, with a filial affection and earnestness, for that holy Society, of which thou art so bright an ornament, and which reposes on thee its firmest confidence. May it more and more flourish under the storm of trial which never leaves it in rest ; may it be multiplied, that so the children of God may be multiplied by its labours ; may it ever have ready, for the service of the Chris- tian world, zealous Apostles and Doctors ; may it not be in vain that it bears the name of Jesus.

Let us consider the wretched condition of the human race, at the time of Christ's coming into the world. The diminution of truths1 is emphatically expressed by the little light, which the earth enjoys at this season of the year. The ancient traditions are gradually becoming extinct ; the Creator is not acknowledged, even in the very work of his hands;

1 Ps. xi. 2.

DEC. 3. ST. FKANCIS XAVIER. 331

everything has been made God, except the God who made all things. This frightful Pantheism produces the vilest immorality, both in society at large, and in individuals. There are no rights acknowledged, save that of might. Lust, avarice, and theft, are honoured by men in the gods of their altars. There is no such thing as Family, for divorce and infanticide are lega- lised ; mankind is degraded by a general system of slavery ; nations are being exterminated by endless wars. The human race is in the last extreme of misery ; and unless the hand that created it reform it, it must needs sink a prey to crime and bloodshed. There are indeed some few just men still left upon the earth, and they struggle against the torrent of universal degradation ; but they cannot save the world ; the world despises them, and God will not accept their merits as a palliation of the hideous leprosy which covers the earth. All flesh has cor- rupted its way, and is more guilty than even in the days of the deluge : and yet, a second destruction of the universe would but manifest anew the justice of God ; it is time that a deluge of his divine mercy should flood the universe, and that He who made man, should come down and heal him. Come then, O eternal Son of God ! give life again to this dead body; heal all its wounds; purify it; let grace super- abound, where sin before abounded ; and having con- verted the world to thy holy law, thou wilt have proved to all ages, that thou who earnest, wast in very truth the Word of the Father ; for as none but a God could create the world, so none but the same omnipotent God could save it from Satan and sin, and restore it to justice and holiness.

DEC. 4. ST. PETER CHRYSOLOGUS. 333

December 4. SAINT PETER CHRYSOLOGUS,

BISHOP AND DOCTOR OF THE CHURCH.

The same divine Providence, which would not that the Church should be deprived of the consolation of keeping, during Advent, the feast of some of the Apostles, who announced to the Gentiles the coming of the Messias, has also willed that the holy Doctors, who defended the true Faith against heretics, should be represented in this important season of the Catholic Year. Two of them, St. Ambrose and St. Peter Chrysologus, shine as two brilliant stars in the firmament of the Church during Advent. It is worthy of note, that both of them were the zealous avengers of that Son of God whom we are preparing to receive. The first was the valiant opponent of the Arians, whose impious doctrine taught that Jesus, the object of our hopes, is merely a creature and not God ; the second was the adversary of Eutyches, whose sacrilegious system robs the Incarnation of the Son of God of all its glory, by asserting that, in this mystery, the human nature was absorbed by the divinity.

It is this second Doctor, the holy Bishop of Ravenna, that we are to honour to-day. His pas- toral eloquence gained for him a great reputation, and a great number of his Sermons have been handed down to us. In almost every page, we find passages

334 ADVENT.

of the most exquisite beauty, though we also occa- sionally meet 'with indications of the decay of litera- ture, which began in the fifth century. The mystery of the Incarnation is a frequent subject of the Saint's Sermons, and he always speaks upon it with a pre- cision and enthusiasm, which show his learning and piety. His veneration and love towards Mary, the Mother of God, who, in that very age, had triumphed over her enemies by the decree of the Council of Ephesus, inspire him with thoughts and language which are extremely fine. Let us take a passage from the Sermon on the Annunciation. " God sends " to the Virgin an Angelic Messenger, who, whilst he " brings grace, gives her the intrusted pledge, and " receives hers. Then does Gabriel return with " Mary's plighted troth. But, before ascending to " heaven, there to tell the consent promised him by " the Yirgin, he delivers to her the gifts due to her " virtues. Swiftly does this Ambassador fly to the " Spouse, that he might assert God's claim to her as " his own. Gabriel takes her not from Joseph, but " he restores her to Christ, to whom she was espoused " when she was first formed in the womb.1 Christ, " therefore, did but take his own, when he thus made " Mary his Spouse. It is not a separation that he * thus produces, but a union to himself of his own -' creature by becoming Incarnate in her womb.

" But let us hearken to the Angel's words. Being " come in, he said unto her : Hail, full of grace ! " the Lord is with thee ! These words are not a mere " salutation ; they convey the heavenly gift. Hail ! " that is, Take, O Mary, the grace I bring thee ; fear " not ; this is not the work of nature. Full of " Grace ! that is, Thou art not in grace as others

1 St. Peter Chrysologus here asserts the mystery of the Imma- culate Conception. If Mary was espoused to the Son of God from the first moment of her existence, how could Original Sin ever have been upon her ?

DEC. 4. ST. PETER CHKYSOLOGTJS. 335

" are, thou art to be rilled with it. The Lord is with " thee ! What means this, but that he is coming to " thee not merely to visit thee, but to enter within " thee by the new mystery of becoming thy Child ? "Blessed art thou among women. How fittingly " does he add these words ! They imply, that they " who heretofore were mothers with the curse of Eve "upon them, now have the Blessed Mary as their "joy, and honour, and type : and whereas Eve was, " by nature, the mother of children of death, Mary " is, by grace, the mother of children of life."1

In the following passage from another Sermon, the Holy Doctor teaches us with what profound veneration we ought to contemplate Mary during these days when God is still residing in her womb. " What reverence and awe are shown to that inner • chamber of a King, where he sits in all the majesty " of his power ! Therein, no man may enter that is " a stranger, or unclean, or unfaithful. The usages " of courts require, that when men come to pay their "homage, everything must be the best, and fairest, "and most loyal. Who would go to the palace- " gate in rags ? Who would go, that knew he was " odious to the Prince ? So it is with the sanctuary " of the divine Spouse. No one is permitted to come " nigh, but he that is of God's family, and is intimate, "and has a good conscience, and has a fair name, " and leads a holy life. Within the holy place itself " God receives but the Virgin, and spotless virginity. "Hence learn, O man, to examine thyself: — who " thou art ? and what thou art ? and what merits " thou hast ? Ask thyself, after this, if thou mayest " dare to penetrate into the mystery of the Birth of " thy Lord, or canst be worthy to approach that "living sanctuary, wherein reposes the whole ma- jesty of the King, and thy God." 2

Let us now listen to our holy Mother the Church, who thus speaks of our Saint.

Petrus, qui ob auream ejus eloquentiam Chrysologi cog- nomen acleptus est, Foro Cornelii in ^Emilia honestis parentibns natus, a prima setate animum ad religionem adjiciens, Cornelio Romano, tunc ejusdem urbis Corneli- ensis Episcopo, operam dedit : a quo etiam scientia et vitas sanctitate quum brevi pro- fecisset, Diaconus creatus est. Postmodum contigit, ut Ra- vennates ob mortem Archi- praesulis sui, alium ut moris erat ab eis electum, Romam ad sanctum Sixtum Papam Tertium pro confirmatione miserint una cum Legatis suis, et cum praedicto Cor- nelio, qui eumdem levitam secum perduxit. Interim sanctus Petrus Apostolus, et Martyr Apollinaris Summo Pontifici in somnis apparu- erunt, mediumque habentes hunc juvenem, jusserunt, ut ilium et non alium, in Archi- episcopum Ravennae crearet.

Peter, surnamed, for his golden eloquence, Chryso- logus, was born at Forum Cornelii (Imola) in ^Emilia, of respectable parents. Turn- ing his mind to religion from his childhood, he put himself under Cornelius, the Bishop of that city, who was a Ro- man. In a short while, he made such progress in learn- ing and holiness of life, that, in due time, the Bishop or- dained him Deacon. Not long after, it happened that the Archbishop of Ravenna having died, the inhabitants of that city sent, as usual, to Rome the successor, they had elected, that this election might be confirmed by the holy Pope Sixtus the Third. Cornelius, who was also sent in company with the deputies of Ravenna, took with him. the young Deacon. Mean- while, the Apostle St. Peter, and the holy Martyr Apollinaris, appeared to the Roman Pontiff in his sleep. They stood with the young levite between them, and ordered the Pontiff to create him, and none other, as Archbishop of Ravenna. The Pontiff, therefore, no sooner saw Peter, than he recognised him as the one chosen by God ; and reject- ing the one presented to him, he appointed Peter to the Metropolitan Church of that

city, in the year of our Lord 433. At first, the deputies from Ravenna were dissatis- fied at this decision of the Pope ; but, having been told of the vision, they readily acquiesced to the divine will, and received the new Arch- bishop with the greatest reverence.

Peter, therefore, being, though reluctant, consecrated Archbishop, was conducted to Ravenna, where he was received with the greatest joy by the Emperor Valentinian, and Galla Placidia the Em- peror's mother, and the whole people. On his part, he told them that he asked of them but this, that since he had not refused this great burden for their salvation's sake, they would make it their study to f ollowhis counsels,andto obey the commandments of God. He then buried in the city the bodies of two Saints, after having embalmed them with the most precious perfumes ; Barbatian, a Priest, was one ; and the other, Germauus, Bishop of Auxerre, whose cowl and hair-shirt he claimed as his own inheritance. He ordained Projectus and Mar- cellinus Bishops. In the town of Classis he erected a fountain of an incredible size, and built some magnificent churches in honour of several Saints, of Saint Andrew among the rest. The peo- ple had a custom of assisting at certain games, on the first day of January, which con-

Dum publice sermones ha- beret ad populum, adeo ve- hemens erat in dicendo, ut prae nimio ardore vox illi interdum defecerit : sicut contigit in concione Haemor- rhoissae.

sisted of theatrical perform- ances and dances ; the Saint repressed these by the seve- rity with which he preached against them. One of his expressions deserves to be handed down : He that would play with the devil, can never enjoy the company of Jesus. At the command of Pope St. Leo the First, he wrote to the Council of Chalcedon against the heresy of Eutyches. He answered Eutyches himself by another epistle, which has been added to the Acts of that same Council in the new editions, and has been in- serted in the Ecclesiastical Annals.

In his sermons to the peo- ple he was so earnest, that at times his voice completely failed him, as in his Sermon on the Women healed by our Lord, as mentioned in the 9 th chapter of St. Matthew ; on which occasion his people of Ravenna were so affected, and so moved to tears, that the whole church rang with their sobbings and prayers, and the Saint afterwards thanked God, for that he had turned the failure of his speech into the gain of so much love. After having governed that Church, in a most holy manner, about eighteen years, and having received a divine warning that his labours were soon to end, he withdrew into his native town. There he visited the Church of St. Cassian, and presented an offering of

a large golden diadem, set with most precious stones, which he placed upon the high Altar ; he also gave a golden cup, and silver paten, which imparts to water poured on it the virtue of healing the bites of mad dogs, and of assuaging fevers, as frequent instances have at- tested. He then took leave of those who had accom- panied him from Ravenna, admonishing them to spare no pains in electing for their Pastor him who was the most worthy. Immediately after this he turned in humble prayer to God, that, through the intercession of his patron St. Cassian, he would mer- cifully receive his soul ; and calmly passed out of this life, on the third of the Nones of December (Dec. 3), about the year 450. His holy body was buried, amidst the tears and prayers of the whole city, near the body of the same St. Cassian : there it is venerated even at this day ; though Ravenna possesses and ve- nerates one of the arms, which was enshrined in gold and gems and placed in the Basilica Ursicana.

Holy Pontiff, who didst open thy lips and pour out on the assembly of the faithful, in the streams of thy golden eloquence, the knowledge of Jesus, cast an eye of compassion on the Christians throughout the world, who are watching in expectation of that same God-Man, whose two Natures thou didst so courageously confess. Obtain for us grace to receive him with that sovereign respect, which is due to a

340 ADVENT,

God who comes down to his creatures, and with that loving confidence, which is due to a Brother who comes to offer himself in sacrifice for his most un- worthy brethren. Strengthen our faith, most holy Doctor ! for the love we stand in need of comes from faith. Destroy the heresies which lay waste the vineyard of our Father ; and uproot that frightful Pantheism, which is the form under which the heresy, thou didst combat, is still among us. May the nu- merous Churches of the East abjure that heresy of Eutyches which reigns so supreme amongst them, and gives them the knowledge of the ineffable mystery of the Incarnation only to blaspheme it. Pray that the children of the Church may show to the judg- ments of the Apostolic See that perfect obedience, to which thou didst so eloquently urge the heresiarch Eutyches, in the Epistle thou didst address to him, and which will ever be precious to the world : " We " exhort thee above all things, most honoured Brother, " that thou receive with obedience whatsoever has " been written by the most blessed Pope of the City " of Borne : for, Blessed Peter, who lives and presides " in his own See, shows the truth of faith to all them " that seek it." (Letter 25.)

DEC. 4. ST. BARBARA. 341

THE SAME DAY.

SAINT BARBARA, VIRGIN AND MARTYR.

Although, in the Roman Liturgy, St. Barbara is merely commemorated in the Office of St. Peter Chrysologus ; yet the Church has approved an entire Office for the use of those Churches which honour the memory of this illustrious Virgin in a special manner. The Legend which follows, although of considerable wTeight, has not, consequently, the autho- rity of those which are promulgated for the use of the whole Church, in the Roman Breviary. Let us not, on this account, be the less fervent in honouring this glorious Martyr, so celebrated in the East, and whose feast has been for so many ages admitted, with more or less solemnity, into the Roman Church. The Acts of her martyrdom, though not of the highest antiquity, contain nothing in them but what re- dounds to the glory of God and the honour of the Saint. We have already shown the liturgical im- portance which attaches to St. Barbara in the season of Advent. Let us admire the constancy wherewith this Virgin waited for her Lord, who came at the appointed hour, and was for her, as the Scripture speaks, a Spouse of blood, because he put the strength of her love of him to the severest of all tests.

Oblata a pat re pluries nobilium connubia fortiter sprevit. Pater vero per sui absentiam fillse ani- mum posse facilius emolliri confidens, jussit primo bal- neum extrui, ne quid ei deesset ad commoditatem ; deinde peregre in exteras regiones profectus est.

readily, by the assistance of divine grace, from the con- templation of the visible things of creation to the knowledge of the invisible. Wherefore, she devoted her- self to God alone and to the things of God. Her father, desirous to preserve her from all danger of insult, to which he feared her great beauty might expose her, shut her up in a tower. There the pious virgin passed her days in meditation and prayer, studying to please God alone, whom she had chosen as her Spouse. She cour- ageously rejected several offers of marriage, which were made to her, through her father, by rich nobles. But her father hoped, that by separating himself by a long absence from his child, her intentions would easily change. He first ordered that a bath should be built for her in the tower, so that she might want for nothing ; and then he set out on a journey into distant coun- tries.

During her father's ab- sence, Barbara ordered that to the two windows already in the tower a third should be added, in honour of the blessed Trinity ; and that on the edge of the bath the sign of the most holy Cross should be drawn. When Dioscorus returned home, and saw these changes, and was told their meaning, he became so incensed against

his daughter, that he went in search of her with a naked sword in his hand, and, but for the protection of God, he would cruelly have mur- dered her. Barbara had taken to flight : an immense rock opened before her, and she found a path by which she reached the top of a mountain, and there she hid herself in a cave. Not long after, however, she was dis- covered by her unnatural father, who savagely kicked and struck her, and dragging her by the hair over the sharp rocks, and rugged ways, he handed her over to the governor Marcian, that he might punish her. He, therefore, having used every means to shake her con- stancy, and finding that all was in vain, gave orders that she should he stripped and scourged with thongs, the wounds to be then scraped with potsherd, and so dragged to prison. There Christ, surrounded by an immense light, appearing to her, strengthened her in a divine manner for the suffer- ings she was yet to endure. A matron, named Juliana, who witnessed this, was con- verted to the faith, and became her companion in the palm of martyrdom.

At length Barbara had her body torn with iron hooks, her sides burnt with torches, and her head bruised with mallets. During these tor- tures she consoled her com-

panion, and exhorted her to fight manfully to the last. Both of them had their breasts cut off, were dragged naked through the streets, and beheaded. The head of Barbara was cut off by her own father, who in his exces- sive wickedness had hardened his heart thus far. But his ferocious cruelty was not long left unpunished, for instantly, and on the very spot, he was struck dead by lightning. The Emperor Justinus had the body of this most holy virgin trans- lated from Nicomedia to Constantinople. It was after- wards obtained by the Vene- tians from the Emperors Constantine and Basil ; and having been translated from Constantinople to Venice, was deposited with great so- lemnity in the Basilica of St. Mark. Lastly, at the earnest request of the Bishop of Torcello and his sister, who was abbess, it was translated in the year of grace 1009, to the Nuns' Church of St. John the Evangelist, in the diocese of Torcello ; where it was placed in a worthy se- pulchre, and from that time has never ceased to be the object of most fervent vene- ration.

Such is the account of the life and martyrdom of the courageous Virgin of Nicomedia. She is invoked in the Church against lightning, on account of the punishment inflicted by divine justice on her execrable father. This same incident of the Saint's history has

DEC. 4. ST. BABBAEA.

345

suggested several Catholic customs : thus, her name is sometimes given to the hold of men-of war where the ammunition is stowed ; she is the Patroness of Artillery-men, Miners, &c; and she is invoked by the faithful against the danger of a sudden death.

Of the Liturgical pieces, used in our Western Churches, in honour of St. Barbara, we will content ourselves with the following beautiful Antiphon, com- posed in the days of chivalry.

ANTIPHON.

O immeasurable mercy of divine goodness, which did enlighten Barbara with the brightness of the true light, making her worthy, by her contempt for what was daz- zling in earthly grandeur, to be admitted to a union with God ! As the lily among thorns, as light in darkness, so shone Barbara. Alleluia.

O divinas bonitatis im- mensa dementia, quse Bar- baram illustravit vero cla- ritatis lumine, ut terrense dignitatis contempto splen- dore, divinitatis conscia ef- fici mereretur : hasc velut lilium inter spinas enituit, et lux in tenebris eluxit. Alleluia.

The Greek Church is profuse in its praises of St. Barbara. We will take from the Menaea a few out of the many Strophes which are sung in honour of the holy Martyr.

HYMN OF THE GEEEK CHUECH.

When welcome death came before thee, O venerable Mar- tyr Barbara ! joyously and nimbly didst thou run thy course, and being immolated by the wicked hands of an impious parent, thou wast offered a victim to God. Now, therefore, art thou in the choir of the truly wise Virgins, and contemplatest the beauty of thy Spouse.

Quando coram te, vene- randa martyr Barbara, dul- cis mors apparuit, gaudens et festinans cursum com- plevisti, impiique genitoris injustis manibus sacrificata est, et Deo oblata es victima: unde vere prudentium Vir- ginum conjuncta choris, tui Sponsi contemplaris splen- dorem.

This lamb of thine, O Jesus, cries to thee with a loud voice : Thee, O my Spouse, do I desire, thee do I seek by my combat ; I am immolated and buried in thy baptism; I suffer for thee, that I may reign with thee ; I die for thee, that I may live in thee ; receive me, there- fore, as an unreserved sacri- fice lovingly sacrificed to thee. Save our souls, O mer- ciful Jesus, by her prayers.

Glorious Barbara I most sacred rose grown out of a thorny stem, sweetly perfum- ing the Church, and ruddy by the blood of thy battle ! we this day most fervently proclaim thee blessed.

Neither the sweetness of luxury, nor the flower of beauty, nor riches, nor the pleasures of youth, could rob thee of thy energy, O glorious Barbara, most fair Virgin, espoused to Christ.

All stood in amazement at witnessing thy combat ; for thou didst endure the tor- tures, and chains, and cruel- ties, of thy persecutors, O Barbara, of wide- world fame! Therefore, did God give thee the crown thou didst covet ; thou didst run thy course with courage, and he healed thee.

Full of love for Jesus thy Spouse, thy bright lamp was well trimmed, and thy vir- tues shed forth their splen- dour, O Virgin, worthy of praise ! Therefore didst thou enter in with Christ to the marriage -feast, and he

wreathed thee with the crown of thy combat. We celebrate thy memory, O Barbara ! Deliver ns from danger.

By those three apertures, which thou would st have to thy bath, thou didst sym- bolise, O Barbara, the mys- tery of Baptism, which, by the light of the Trinity, im- parts to our souls a cleansing that illuminates.

Fleeing the terrible vio- lence of her father, a rock im- mediately opened a reception of safety to Barbara, as hap- pened heretofore to the illus- trious Protomartyr of her sex, Thecla, for whom Christ worked a like miracle.

O Martyr Barbara ! thou wast sacrificed with a sword, by thy father, like in this to Abraham ; but his devoted- ness was to the devil.

Jesus appeared to thee, O Barbara, in thy prison : he was surrounded by light in- accessible, but he came to animate thy confidence, heal thy wounds and make thee glad : this gave wings to thy love of thy Lord.

When for Christ's sake thou wast stripped of thy gar- ments, O venerable Barbara ! a bright Angel clothed thee, as a bride, with a splendid robe, which covered thy wounds ; for thou hast put on the stole which gives crea- tures a divine transforma- tion.

Thy prophecy, 0 Christ, has been evidently fulfilled : for the father delivers his daughter up to death, nay

To this the voice of so many Cnurches we join ours, O faithful Virgin ! and though we are unworthy, yet do we offer thee our praise and our prayers. Behold S our Lord cometh, and the darkness of the night is upon us ; give to our lamp both the light which will guide us, and the oil which will keep in the light. Thou knowest that he who came for love of thee, and with whom thou art now united for all eternity, is coming to visit us too ; pray for us that nothing may keep us from receiving him. May we go towards him courageously and swiftly as thou didst, and being once with him, may we never be separated from him again, for he is the centre where we creatures find our only rest. Pray also, 0 glorious Martyr, that the faith in the Blessed Trinity may be ever increasing in this world. May our enemy, Satan, be confounded by every tongue's confessing the Threefold light, and the triumphant Cross which sanctifies the waters of Baptism. Remember, O blessed Barbara, thou Spouse of Jesus, that he has put in thy gentle hands the power not of burling but of staying and averting the thunderbolt. Protect our ships against the fires of heaven and of war. Shield by thy protection the

arsenals where are placed the defence of our country. Hear the prayers of them that invoke thee, whether in the fierceness of the storm, or in the dark depths of the earth ; and save us all from the awful chas- tisement of a sudden death.

Let us consider how the various nations on the face of the earth, though differing in customs, and speech, and interests, are all united in the expecta- tion of a Deliverer soon to come. Neither the fright- ful corruption of morals, nor the loog ages which have passed since the promises were given, have been able to efface the tradition, or the hope it inspired. At the very time when the world seems crumbling into dissolution, there is evinced a strong symptom of vigour, and from one end of the earth to the other there is heard this cry : The King of the universe is soon to appear; a new Empire, holy and everlasting, is to bring all peoples into one. It is thus, O Jesus ! that Jacob prophesied on his dying bed, when he said, speaking of thee : He shall be the Expectation of nations.1 Men have, indeed, searched after, and found, the way to the lowest degradation ; but they could not prevent the fulfilment of this prophecy : and by their expectation of a happier state of things, they themselves fulfil it ; and by fulfilling it, are con- fessing that their misery has no remedy save thyself. Come, then, O Son of God ! and cherish this ray of hope, of the ancient world, which renders thee this its only homage, even whilst falling under the weight of its own wretchedness. The expectation of a De- liverer is the bond of union between the two great divisions of the human race, those who preceded and those who have lived since thy Nativity. But, if the pagan world, from the depth of its vices and errors, could sigh after thee, O Jesus ! what shall we not do,

who have inherited what was promised, now that thou art preparing to come and take possession of our souls % We already know thee, for thou hast initiated us into thy Mysteries ; we cannot do less, dear Jesus ! we are longing for thee during these days of Advent. When the beautiful day of thy visit comes, mayst thou find that thy love is already in our hearts. Make our expectation more fervid, increase our faith, and Come !

December 5. COMMEMORATION OF ST. SABAS, ABBOT.

The Roman Church confines herself to-day to the Office of the Feria ; but to that she joins a Comme- moration of St. Sabas, Abbot of the celebrated Laura of Palestine, which still exists under his name. This Saint, who died in 533, is the only one of the Monas- tic Order of whom the Church makes any mention in her Liturgy during the whole period of Advent ; we might even say that he is the only simple Con- fessor whose name occurs in the Calendar of this part of the year ; for, as regards St. Francis Xavier, the glorious title of Apostle of the Indies puts him in a distinct class of Saints. Here again we should recognise Divine Providence, which has selected, for these days of preparation for Christmas, those Saints whose characteristic virtues would make them our fittest models in this work of preparation. We have the feasts of Apostles, Pontiffs, Doctors, Virgins : Jesus, the Man-God, the King and Spouse of men, is preceded by this magnificent procession of the noblest of his servants : simple Confession has but a single representative, the Anchoret and Cenobite Sabas, who, by his profession of the monastic life, is of that family of holy solitaries, which began with the Prophet Elias under the Old Testament, and continued up to the time of St. John the Precursor, who was one of its members, and will continue on, during the New Covenant, until the last Coming of Jesus. Let us, then, honour this holy Abbot, towards whom the Greek Church professes a filial veneration, and under whose invocation Borne has consecrated

one of her Churches. Let us beg his prayers by this Collect of the holy Liturgy :

Christ our Lord. Amen.

O Sabas, thou man of desires ! in thy expectation of that Lord, who has bid his servants watch until he come, thou didst withdraw into the desert, fearing lest the turmoil of the world might distract thy mind from its God. Have pity on us who are living in the world, and are so occupied in the affairs of that world, and yet who have received the commandment which thou didst so take to heart, of keeping ourselves in readiness for the Coming of our Saviour, and our Judge. Pray for us, that when he comes, we may be worthy to go out to meet him. Remember also the Monastic State, of which thou art one of the brightest ornaments ; raise it up again from its ruins ; let its children be men of prayer and faith, as of old ; let thy spirit be among them, and the Church thus regain, by thy intercession, all the glory which is reflected on her from the sublime perfection of this holy State.

Let us look again at the Prophecy of Jacob. The holy Patriarch not only foretells that the Messias will be the Expectation of nations ; he adds, that when this promised Deliverer comes, the sceptre will have been taken away from Juda.1 This oracle is now

filled. The flag of Caesar Augustus floats on the ramparts of Jerusalem. The Temple is still un- touched ; the abomination of desolation stands not yet in the holy place ; sacrifices are there still offered up to God : but then, the true Temple of God, the Incarnate Word, has not yet been built ; the Syna- gogue has not denied Him, who was her expectation; the Victim, that was to supersede all others, has not been immolated. Yet, Juda has no Chief of her own race ; Caesar's coin is current throughout all Pales- tine ; and the day is not far off when the leaders of the Jewish people will own, in the presence of the Roman Governor, that they have not the power to put any man to death.1 So that there is now no King upon the throne of David and Solomon, that throne which was to abide for ever. O Jesus ! Son of David, and King of Peace, now is the time when thou must show thyself, and take possession of the Sceptre which has been taken in battle from the hand of Juda, and put, for a time, into that of an Emperor. Come ! for thou art King, and the Psalmist, thy an- cestor, thus saug of thee : " Gird thy sword upon thy " thigh, O thou most Mighty ! With thy comeliness " and thy beauty set out, proceed prosperously, and " reign, because of truth and meekness and justice, " and thy right hand shall conduct thee wonderfully. " Thy arrows are sharp : under thee shall people fall : " thy arroivs shall go into the hearts of the King's •' enemies. Thy throne is for ever and ever ; the " sceptre of the kingdom is a sceptre of uprightness. " . . . . God, thy God, hath anointed thee, 0 Christ ! " who tahest thence thy name, with the oil of gladness " above thy fellows, who have been honoured with " the name of King"2 When thou art come, O Messias ! men will be no more as sheep going astray without a shepherd ; there will be but one fold, in

which thou wilt reign by love and justice, for all power will be given unto thee in heaven and on earth. When, in the hour of thy Passion, thy enemies shall ask thee: Art thou King I thou wilt answer them in all truth : Verily, I am.1 Come, dearest King, and reign over our hearts ; come, and reign over this world, which is thine because thou didst create it, and will soon be thine because thou wilt have redeemed it. Reign, then, over this world, and delay not the manifestation of thy royal power until the day of which it is written : he will break Kings in the day of his wrath;2 reign from this very hour, and let all people fall at thy feet and adore thee in one grand homage of love and obedience.

December 6. SAINT NICHOLAS, BISHOP OF MYRA,

AND CONFESSOR.

Divine Wisdom has willed that on the way which leads to the Messias, our Great High Priest, there should be many Pontiffs to pay him the honour due to him. Two Popes, St. Melchiades and St. Damasus ; two Holy Doctors, St. Peter Chrysologus and St. Ambrose; two Bishops, St. Nicholas and St. Eusebius: these are the glorious Pontiffs who have been en- trusted with the charge of preparing, by their prayers, the way of the Christian people towards Him, who is the Sovereign Priest according to the order of Melchisedecb. As each of their feasts comes, w& will show their right to have been thu£ admitted into the court of Jesus. To-day the Church cele- brates with joy the feast of the great Thaumaturgus Nicholas, who is to the Greek Church what St. Martin is to us. The Church of Rome has honoured the name of Nicholas for nearly a thousand years. Let us admire the wonderful power which God gave him over creation ; but let us offer him our most fervent congratulations in that he was permitted to be one of the three hundred and eighteen Bishops, who proclaimed, at Nicsea, that the Word is Consubstam- tial to the Father. The humiliations ,of the Son of God did not scandalise him. Neither the lowliness of the flesh, which the Sovereign Lord of all things assumed to himself in the womb of the Virgin, nor the poverty of the crib, hindered him from confess- ing to be Son of God, equal to God, Him who is the Son of Mary : and for this reason, God has glorified this his servant, and given him the power to obtain,

each year, for the children of the Church, the grace of receiving this same Jesus, the Word, with simple faith and fervent love. Let us now listen to the eulogy of St. Nicholas, which the Rornan Church has inserted in her Liturgy.

Nicolaum-, illustri loco Pa- targe in Lycia natum, paren- tes a Deo precious impetra- runt. Cujus viri sanctitas, quanta futura esset, jam ab incimabulis apparuit. Ham infans, quum reliquos dies lac nutricis frequens sugeret, quarta et sexta feria semel duntaxat, idque vesperi, su- gehat : quam jejunii consue- tudinem in rehqua vita sem- per tenuit. Adolescens pa- rentibus orbatus, facilitates suas pauperibus distribuit. Cujus illud insigne est Chris- tianas benignitatis exem- plum, quod quum ejus civis egens tres filias jam nubiles in matrimonio collocare non posset, earumque pudicitiam prostituere cogitaret : re cognita, Nicolaus noctu per fenestram tantum pecuniae in ejus domum injecit, quan- tum unius virginis doti satis esset : quod quum iterum et tertio fecisset, tres illae vir- gines honestis viris, in matri- monium datae sunt.

Quum vero se totum Deo dedisset, in Palaestinam pro- lectus est, ut loca sancta

Nicholas was born in the celebrated city of Patara, in the province of Lycia. His birth was the fruit of his parents' prayers. Evidences of his great future holiness were given from his very cradle. For when he was an infant, he would only take his food once on Wednesdays and Fridays, and then not till evening ; whilst on all other days he frequently took the breast : he kept up this custom of fasting during the rest of his life. Having lost his parents when he was a boy, he gave all his goods to the poor. Of his Christian kindheartedness there is the following noble example. One of his fellow-citizens had three daughters ; but being too poor to obtain them an honourable marriage, he was minded to abandon them to a life of prostitution. Nicho- las having got to know the case, went to the house during the night and threw in by the window a sum of money suf- ficient for the dower of one of the daughters ; he did the same a second and a third time ; and thus the three were married to respectable men.

Having given himself wholly to the service of God, he set out for Palestine, that

he might visit and venerate the holy places. During this pilgrimage, which he made by sea, he foretold to the mariners, on embarking, though the heavens were then serene and the sea tranquil, that they would be overtaken by a frightful storm. In a very short time, the storm arose. All were in the most imminent danger, when he quelled it by his prayers. His pilgrimage ended, he re- turned home, giving to all men example of the greatest sanctity. He went, by an in- spiration from God, to Myra, the Metropolis of Lycia, which had just lost its Bishop by death, and the Bishops of the province had come together for the purpose of electing a successor. Whilst they were holding council for the elec- tion, they were told by a re- velation from heaven, that they should choose him who, on the morrow, should be the first to enter the church, his name being Nicholas. Accor- dingly, the requisite observa- tions were made, when they found Nicholas to be waiting at the church door : they took him, and, to the incre- dible delight of all, made him the Bishop of Myra. Dur- ing his episcopate, he never flagged in the virtues looked for in a bishop ; chastity, which indeed he had always preserved, gravity, assiduity in prayer, watchings, absti- nence, generosity, and hospi- tality, meekness in exhorta- tion, severity in reproving.

He befriended widows and orphans by money, by advice, and by every service in his power. So zealous a de- fender was he of all who suf- fered oppression, that, on one occasion, three Tribunes having been condemned by the Emperor Constantine, who had been deceived by calumny, and having heard of the miracles wrought by Nicholas, they recommended themselves to his prayers, though he was living at a very great distance from that place : the saint appeared to Constantine, and angrily looking upon him, obtained from the terrified Emperor their deliverance. Having, contrary to the edict _ of Dioclesian and Maximian, preached in Myra the truth of the Christian faith, he was taken up by the servants of the two Emperors. He was taken off to a great distance andthrown into prison, where he remained until Constan- tine, having become Emperor, ordered his rescue, and the Saint returned to Myra. Shortly afterwards, he repair- ed to the Council which was being held at Nicsea : there he took part with the three hun- dred and eighteen Fathers in condemning the Arian heresy. Scarcely had he returned to his See. than he was taken with the sickness of which he soon died. Looking up to heaven, and seeing Angels coming to meet him, he began the Psalm, In thee, 0 Lord, have

I hoped; and having come to those words, Into thy hands I commend my spirit, his soul took its flight to the heavenly country. His body, having been translated to Bari in Apulia, is the object of universal veneration.

Almost all the Breviaries of the Latin Church, up to the 17th century, contain most fervent praises of the virtues and miracles of St. Nicholas, and give the beautiful Office of the holy Bishop, which was com- posed about the 12th century. We have spoken elsewhere upon this Office, as far as regards the music ; at present we will only mention its being drawn up exclusively on the Acts of St. Nicholas, and its being more explicit on some circumstances of the Saint's life than is the Legend of the Roman Breviary. The following portions of this Office dwell with complacency on a fact which is not mentioned in our Liturgy : we mean the miraculous oil, which, for almost eight hundred years, has flowed without ceasing from the tomb of the holy Bishop, and by means of which God has frequently wrought miracles. The Responsory and Antiphon, which we give, are upon the miracle of the oil itself. They were formerly so familiar to the faithful, that in the 13th century their music was sung to the Responsory Unus Panis, and to the Antiphon 0 quam suavis est, of the Office of Corpus Christi.

O ! the mercy of Christ, worthy of all our praise ! which makes known, through the length and breadth of the world, the merits of his ser- vant Nicholas : for from his tomb there flows an oil, and it heals all that are infirm.

HYMN I.

Dum penderet ad mamil- lam Matris, ab infantia, Quarta semel bibit illam, Atque sexta feria ; Ne per lactis puer stillam, Solveret jejunia.

Sublimatus ad honorem Nicolaus Prsesulis, Pietatis ita rorem Cunctis pluit populis ; Ut vix parem aut majorem Habeat in sseculis.

Auro dato, violari Virgines prohibuit ; Far in fame, vas in mari, Servat et distribuit ; Qui timebant naufragari, Nautis opem tribuit.

A defunctis suscitatur Furtum qui commiserat ; Et Judaeus baptizatur, Furtumque recuperat ;

Tell, 0 my tongue, the praise of the Pontiff Nicholas that so the sovereign Adonai, the King and Father of all creatures, may grant us to be brought by his Son, to the port of salvation.

When yet a babe at his mother's breast, he took it but once on each fourth and sixth feria, nor would the child break his fast by one drop of milk.

Elevated to the dignity of Pontiff, Nicholas so abun- dantly gave to all men the dew of piety, that scarce could any age find a better or so good a Pastor.

He gives his gold to secure virgins their treasure ; he distributes corn to the people in a famine ; he brings up from the depths of the sea a vase that had fallen in ; he brings help to mariners who were well nigh to shipwreck.

He brings to life a dead man who had committed a theft ; the Jew is baptized and recovers what had been

stolen from him ; the one is restored to life ; the other is brought to the faith.

Nicholas ! thou fair gem, and honour, and glory of the priesthood ! help _ by thy gracious intercession the whole people, the whole clergy; that their minds, and hands, and lips, may pay their tribute to our God.

Praise, power, and tri- umph, to the most High Trinity ! May it give us to come, after this life, with our laurel wreaths upon us, to the joys which Nicholas the Blessed possesses in our country of heaven. Amen.

HYMN II.

Let the clergy joyfully raise their voice in song, and magnify Nicholas the father and patron of the clergy; and let their chants give fresh devotion to their already fervent and docile heart.

Let the Greeks, and Latins, and every tongue and tribe and nation ; let the sea, and land ; let all, whatever their sex or condition, guest or citizen or stranger, sing the praises of Nicholas with one like enthusiasm.

This Pontiff, whose name is immortal in the memory of men, ever gave, gives, and will give favours to all ; he will make him, who was pining away in grief, bloom in joy as a lily.

Whilst living in the flesh he spurned the deeds of the flesh; he did nothing and

spoke nothing but what was unto salvation ; and now, having been loosed from the bonds of the flesh, he has mounted to the starry realms. _ How great is the power of his charity, even in this very age, is plainly enough mani- fested by the oil which flows from his tomb, giving to all people, that ask it, the boon of health.

Praise, power, and triumph to the most High Trinity ! May it give us to come, after this life, with our laurel wreaths upon us, to the joys which Nicholas the Blessed possesses in our country of heaven. Amen.

It was impossible for Adam of Saint- Victor to remain silent in the praises of St. Nicholas. The Churches, in the Middle Ages, received from him the following beautiful Sequence.

Quse sit virtus charitatis Hoc praesenti sasculo, Oleum declarat satis, Quod manat de tumulo ; Et dat munus sanitatis Imploranti populo.

Sit laus summse Trinitati, Virtus et victoria, Quse det nobis ut beati Nicolai gaudia Assequamur laureati, Post vitam in patria.

Amen.

With our hearts and songs in unison, let us exult on this festive solemnity of Blessed Nicholas,

When a babe in his cradle, he began to fast,

And thus deserved, before weaned from the breast, the joys of heaven.

He enters, when a boy, upon a course of studies,

Yet follows not, yet knows not, impurity.

Blessed Confessor indeed, whose worth was known by a message from heaven,

At whose bidding he was promoted and exalted to the supreme dignity of Pontiff.

There was in his soul the most tender compassion, which prompted him to be- stow continual benefits on them who suffered oppres- sion.

He averted infamy from virgins by the gold he gave ; and by the same he relieved their father's poverty.

There were some mariners had set sail ; when a furious storm attacked them, and their bark was well-nigh wrecked :

Despairing of life, and in this extreme danger, they cry out with one voice, saying :

" O holy Nicholas ! help us out of these straits of death, and lead us into har- bour !

" Yea, lead us into har- bour, thou whose kind heart is ever ready to help them that are in affliction."

They prayed ; nor was it in vain : for lo ! a voice was heard saying : " I am here to help you."

Straightways arose a fa- vourable wind : the storm was lulled : the sea was calm.

From his tomb there flows an abundant oil :

It heals all kinds of sick- ness, through the intercession of the Saint.

We who are now living in this world, have already suf- fered shipwreck in the sea of sin :

Ah ! glorious Nicholas, lead us into the harbour of

But none of the Sequences of St. Nicholas were so popular as the one we now give. It is to be found in a great many Processionals up to the 1 7th century, and on its model were composed innumerable others, which, though drawn up in praise of various Patrons, not only kept the measure and the melody, but the very expressions, ingeniously turned here and there, of the Sequence of St. Nicholas.

Nam qui corde poscit ilium Propulsato vitio, Sospes regreditur.

But no Church has evinced such enthusiasm for St. Nicholas as the Greek Church in its Mensea. This illustrious Thaumaturgus was evidently one- of the firmest hopes of the Byzantine Empire, and Con- stantinople transmitted the same confidence to Russia, which even to this day professes great devo- tion to St. Nicholas. We extract, as usual, a few stanzas from the sacred chants which the Church of Saint Sophia anciently sang in the Greek language, and which the gilded domes of Moscow re-echo still, every year, in Sclavonic.

HYMN OF ST. NICHOLAS.

{Taken from the Merited of the Greeks.)

Thou didst dwell in My- ra, and being spiritually anointed, thou didst show thyself to be truly a mystic myrrh, 0 Saintly Nicholas, great High Priest of Christ !

helper of them that are in temptation. Wheresoever thou art invoked, thou swiftly art with those that lovingly have recourse to thy protec- tion, for day and night thou showest thyself to the eye of faith, and savest them from temptations and necessities.

Thou didst appear to the Emperor Constantine and to Ablavius in their sleep, ter- rifying them, and thus bid- ding them speedily set their prisoners free : " These men, " whom ye keep bound in " prison, deserve not the " death ye have unjustly " sentenced them to : and if " thou, O Prince, settest my " word at nought, I will be- " seechingly bear a petition " against thee to the Lord."

Thou didst fix thy keen vision on the heights of the Mystery, and didst look down into the cloud-covered abyss of Wisdom. O Father, that didst enrich the world by thy doctrines, pray for us to Christ, 0 High Priest Nicholas !

Christ our God showed thee to thy flock as the rule of faith and the model of meekness, thou High Priest, thou sainted Hierarch Ni- cholas ! for thou pourest forth in Myra a delicious fragrance, and thy splendid deeds give out their bright light, thou the protector of the orphan and the widow : therefore, cease not to pray for the salvation of our souls.

Rejoice, O thou thatburn- est with divine zeal, who, by thy terrible threat spoken to men in their dream, didst rescue them that were un- justly condemned to death. O fount of Myra overflowing with sweetness, that refresh- est souls, that cleanest what passion defiles !

Holy Pontiff Nicholas, how great is thy glory in God's Church 1 Thou didst confess the name of Jesus before the proconsuls of the world's empire,

and suffer persecution for his name's sake; after- wards, thou wast witness to the wonderful workings of God, when he restored peace to his Church ; and a short time after this again, thou didst open thy lips, in the assembly of the three hundred and eighteen Fathers, to confess with supreme authority the Divinity of our Saviour Jesus Christ, for whose sake so many millions of Martyrs had already shed their blood. Receive the devout felicitations of the Christian people throughout the universe, who thrill with joy when they think of thy glorious merits. Help us by thy prayers during these days when we are preparing for the coming of Him, whom thou didst proclaim to be Consubstantial to the Father. Vouchsafe to assist our faith and to obtain fresh fervour to our love. Thou now beholdest face to face that Word by whom all things were made and redeemed ; beseech him to permit our unworthiness to approach him. Be thou our intercessor with him. Thou hast taught us to know him as the sovereign and eternal God ; teach us also to love him as the supreme benefactor of the children of Adam. It was from him, 0 charitable Pontiff, that thou didst learn that tender compassion for the sufferings of thy fellow -men, which made all thy miracles to be so many acts of kindness : cease not, now that thou art in the company of the Angels, to have pity on and to succour our miseries.

Stir up and increase the faith of mankind in the Saviour whom the Lord has sent them. May this be one of the fruits of thy prayer, that the Divine Word may be no longer unknown and forgotten in this world, which he has redeemed with his Blood. Ask for the pastors of the Church that spirit of charity, which shone so brilliantly in thee ; that spirit which makes them like their divine Master, and wins them the hearts of their people.

Remember, too, 0 holy Pontiff, that Church of the

DEC. 6. ST. NICHOLAS. 369

East which still loves thee so fervently. When thou wast on this earth, God gave thee power to raise the dead to life ; pray now, that the true life, which con- sists in Faith and Unity, may return once more and animate that body which schism has robbed of its soul. By thy supplications, obtain of God that the sacrifice of the Lamb, who is so soon to visit us, may be again and soon celebrated under the cupolas of Saint Sophia. May the sanctuaries of Kiow and Moscow become re-sanctified by the return of the people to unity. May the pride of the Crescent be humbled into submission to the Cross, and the majesty of the Czar be brought to acknowledge the power of the Keys of Saint Peter ; that thus there may be henceforth neither Scythian, nor Barbarian, but one fold under one Shepherd.

Let us resume our considerations upon the state of the world at the time immediately preceding the coming of the Messias. Everything proves that the prophecies which foretold the great event have now been fulfilled. Not only has the sceptre been taken from Juda; the Weeks of Daniel also are almost ex- pired. The other Scriptural predictions relative to the great revolutions, which were to take place in the world, have been successively fulfilled. The Empires of the Assyrians, the Medes, the Persians, and the Greeks, have fallen one after the other ; that of the Romans is now at the zenith of its greatness ; in its turn, it must yield to the eternal Empire of the Messias. This succession of Empires, which was to result in a perfect kingdom, was foretold ; and all is now ready for its final accomplishment. God has also said, by one of his Prophets : Yet one little

while, and I will move heaven and earth

and I will move all nations, and the Desired of all

nations shall come.1 Descend, therefore, O thou Eternal Word! All is consummated. The misery of the world is extreme ; the crimes of men cry to heaven for vengeance ; the whole human race is threatened with self-destruction, and without know- ing what it does, it calls for thee as its only resource. Then come ! All the predictions which were to desig- nate the Redeemer, have been spoken and promul- gated. There is no longer a Prophet in Israel, and the oracles of the Gentile world have ceased to speak. Come, Lord Jesus, and fulfil all things, for the ful- ness of time has come.

DEC. 7. ST. AMBROSE. 371

December 7. SAINT AMBROSE,

BISHOP AND DOCTOR OF THE CHURCH.

This illustrious Pontiff was deservedly placed in the Calendar of the Church side by side with the glorious Bishop of Myra. Nicholas confessed, at Nicsea, the divinity of the Redeemer ; Ambrose, in his city of Milan, was the object of the hatred of the Arians, and, by his invincible courage, triumphed over the enemies of Christ. Let Ambrose, then, unite his voice, as Doctor of the Church, with that of St. Peter Chrysologus, and preach to the world the glories and the humiliations of the Messias. But, as Doctor of the Church, he has a special claim to our veneration : it is, that among the bright luminaries of the Latin Church, four great Masters head the list of sacred Interpreters of the Faith ; Gregory, Augustine, Jerome ; and then our glorious Ambrose, Bishop of Milan, makes up the mystic number.

Ambrose owes his noble position in the Calendar to the ancient custom of the Church, whereby, in the early ages, no Saint's feast was allowed to be kept in Lent. The day of his departure from this world and of his entrance into heaven was the fourth of April, which, more frequently than not, comes during Lent : so that it was requisite that the memory of his sacred death should be solemnised on some other

372 ADVENT.

day, and the seventh of December naturally pre- sented itself for such a feast, inasmuch as it was the anniversary -day of Ambrose's being consecrated Bishop.

But, independently of these considerations, the road which leads us to Bethlehem could be perfumed by nothing so fragrant as by this feast of St. Am- brose. Does not the thought of this saintly and amiable Bishop impress us with the image of dignity and sweetness combined ? of the strength of the lion united with the gentleness of the dove? Time re- moves the deepest human impressions; but the memory of Ambrose is as vivid and dear in men's minds as though he was still among us. Who can ever forget the young, yet staid and learned governor of Liguria and Emilia, who comes to Milan as a simple catechumen, and finds himself forced, by the acclamations of the people, to ascend the episcopal throne of this great city ? And how indelibly im- pressed upon us are certain touching incidents of his early life ! For instance, that beautiful presage of his irresistible eloquence, — the swarm of bees coming round him as he was sleeping one day in his father's garden, and entering into his mouth, as though they would tell us how sweet that babe's words would be? and the prophetic gravity with which Ambrose, when quite a boy, would hold out his hand to his mother and sister, bidding them kiss it, for that one day it would be the hand of a Bishop !

But what hard work awaited the neophyte of Milan, who was no sooner regenerated in the waters of baptism, than he was consecrated Priest and Bishop ! He had to apply himself, there and then, to a close study of the sacred Scriptures, that so he might prepare himself to become the defender of the Church, w7hich was attacked, in the fundamental dogma of the Incarnation, by the false science of the Arians. In a short time he attained such proficiency

DEC. 7. ST. AMBROSE. o73

in the sacred sciences, as to become, like the Prophet, a wall of brass, which checked the further progress of Arianism : not only so, but the works written by Ambrose possessed that plenitude and surety of doctrine, as to be numbered by the Church among the most faithful and authoritative interpretations of her teaching.

But Ambrose had other and fiercer contests than those of religious controversy to encounter r his very life was more than once threatened by the heretics whom he had silenced. What a sublime spectacle that of a Bishop blockaded in his church by the troops of the Empress Justina, and defended within by his people, day and night ! Pastor and flock, both are admirable. How had Ambrose merited such fidelity and confidence on the part of this people ? By a whole life spent for the welfare of his city and his country. He had never ceased to preach Jesus to all men ; and now, the people see their Bishop become, by his zeal, his devotedness, and his self- sacrificing conduct, a living image of Jesus.

In the midst of these dangers which threatened his person, his great soul was calm and seemingly unconscious of the fury of his enemies. It was on that very occasion that he instituted, at Milan, the choral singing of the Psalms. Up to that time, the holy Canticles had been given from the Ambo by the single voice of a Lector ; but Ambrose, shut up in his Basilica with his people, takes the opportunity, and forms two choirs, bidding them respond to each other the verses of the Psalms. The people forgot their trouble in the delight of this heavenly music ; nay, the very howling of the tempest, and the fierce- ness of the siege they were sustaining, added en- thusiasm to this first exercise of their new privilege. Such was the chivalrous origin of Alternate Psalm- ody in the Western Church. Borne adopted the practice, which Ambrose was the first to introduce, and which will continue to be observed to the end of

374 ADVENT.

time. During these hours of struggle with his ene- mies, the glorious Bishop has another gift wherewith to enrich the faithful people who are defending him at the risk of their own lives. Ambrose is a poet, and he has frequently sung, in verses full of sweet- ness and sublimity, the greatness of the God of the Christians, and the mysteries of man's salvation. He now gives to his devoted people these hymns, which he had only composed for his own private de- votion. The Basilicas of Milan soon echoed these accents of the sublime soul which first uttered them. Later on, the whole Latin Church adopted them ; and in honour of the holy Bishop who had thus opened one of the richest sources of the sacred Liturgy, a Hymn was, for a long time, called after his name, an Ambrosian. The Divine Office thus received a new mode of celebrating the divine praise, and the Church, the Spouse of Christ, possessed one means more of giving expression to the sentiments which animate her.

Thus our Hymns, and the alternate singing of the Psalms, are trophies of Ambrose's victory. He had been raised up by God not for his own age only, but also for those which were to follow. Hence, the Holy Ghost infused into him the knowledge of Christian jurisprudence, that he might be the defender of the rights of the Church at a period when paganism still lived, though defeated ; and imperialism, or cesarism, had still the instinct, though not the uncontrolled power, to exercise its tyranny. Ambrose's law was the Gospel, and he would acknowledge no law which was in opposition to that. He could not understand such imperial policy as that of ordering a Basilica to be given up to the Arians, for quietness' sake ! He would defend the inheritance of the Church ; and in that defence, would shed the last drop of his blood. Certain courtiers dared to accuse him of tyranny : " No," answered the Saint, " Bishops are not tyrants,

DEC. 7. ST. AMBROSE. 375

" but have often to suffer from tyranny." The eunuch Calligonus, high chamberlain of the Emperor Valen- tinian the Second had said to Ambrose: "What! " darest thou, in my presence, to care so little for " Valentinian ! I will cut off thy head." " I would " it might be so," answered Ambrose, " I should then " die as a Bishop, and thou wouldst have done what " eunuchs are wont to do."

This noble courage in the defence of the rights of the Church, showed itself even more clearly on another occasion. The Roman Senate, or rather that portion of the Senate, which, though a minority, was still Pagan, was instigated by Symmachus, the Prefect of Rome, to ask the Emperor for the re-erection of the altar of Victory in the Capitol, under the pretext of averting the misfortunes which threatened the empire. Ambrose, who had said to these politicians, " I hate " the Religion of the Neros," vehemently opposed this last effort of idolatry. He presented most eloquent petitions to Valentinian, in which he protested against an attempt, whose object was to bring a Christian Prince to recognise that false doctrines have rights, and which would, if permitted to be tried, rob Him, who is the one only Master of nations, of the victo- ries which he had won. Valentinian yielded to these earnest remonstrances, which taught him "that a " Christian Emperor can only honour one Altar, — the " Altar of Christ ; " and when the Senators had to receive their answer, the prince told them, that Rome was his mother, and he loved her ; but that God was his Saviour, and he would obey Him.

If the Empire of Rome had not" been irrevocably condemned by God to destruction, the influence which St. Ambrose had over such well-intentioned princes as Valentinian would probably have saved it. The Saint's maxim to the Rulers of the world was this, though it was not to be realised in any of them until new kingdoms should spring up out of the ruins of

376 ADVENT.

the Roman Empire, and those new kingdoms and peoples organised by the Christian Church : but St. Ambrose could have no other, and he therefore taught the Emperors of those times, that "an Emperor's " grandest title is to be a Son of the Church. An * Emperor is in the Church, he is not over her."

It is beautiful to see the affectionate solicitude of St. Ambrose for the young Emperor Gratian, at whose death he shed floods of tears. How tenderly, too, did he not love Theodosius, that model Christian prince, for whose sake God retarded the fall of the Empire, by the uninterrupted victory over all its enemies ! On one occasion, indeed, this Son of the Church showed in himself the Pagan Caesar ; but his holy father Ambrose, by a severity, which was inflex- ible because his affection for the culprit was great, brought him back to his duty and his God. "I " loved," says the holy Bishop, in the funeral oration which he preached over Theodosius, " I loved this " Prince, who preferred correction to flattery. He " stripped himself of his royal robes, and publicly " wept in the Church for the sin he had committed, " and into which he had been led by evil counsel. " In sighs and tears he sought to be forgiven. He, " an Emperor, did what common men would be " ashamed to do, he did public penance; and for the " rest of his life, he passed not a day without bewail- " ing his sin."

But we should have a very false idea of St. Am- brose, if we thought that he only turned his attention to affairs of importance like these, which brought him before the notice of the world. No pastor could be more solicitous than he about the slightest details which affected the interests of his flock. We have his life written by his deacon, Paulinus, who knew secrets which intimacy alone can know, and these fortunately he has revealed to us. Among other things, he tells us that when Ambrose heard confes-

DEC. 7. ST. -AMBROSE. 377

sions, he shed so many tears that the sinner was forced to weep : " You would have thought," says Paulinus, " that they were his own sins that he was " listening to." We all know the tender paternal interest he felt for Augustine, when he was a slave to error and his passions ; and if we would have a faithful portrait of Ambrose, we must read in the Confessions of the Bishop of Hippo the fine passage where he expresses his admiration and gratitude for his spiritual father. Ambrose had told Monica, that her son Augustine, who gave her so much anxiety, would be converted. That happy day at last came ; it was Ambrose's hand which immersed into the cleansing waters of Baptism him who was to be the prince of the Doctors of the Church.

A heart thus loyal in its friendship, could not but be affectionate to those who were -related by ties of blood. He tenderly loved his brother Satyrus, as we may see from the two funeral orations which he has left us upon this brother, wherein he speaks his praises with all the warmth of enthusiastic admira- tion. He had a sister, too, named Marcellina, who was equally dear to her saintly brother. From her earliest years, she had spurned the world, and its pomps, and the position which she might expect to enjoy in it, as being a Patrician's daughter. She had received the veil of virginity from the hands of Pope Liberius, but lived in her father's house at Rome. Her brother Ambrose was separated from her, but he seemed to love her the more for that ; and he com- municated with her in her holy retirement by fre- quent letters, several of which are still extant. She deserved all the esteem which Ambrose had for her ; she had a great love for the Church of God, and she was heart and soul in all the great undertakings of her brother the Bishop. The very heading of these letters shows the affection of the Saint: " The Brother " to the Sister ;" or, " To my sister Marcellina, dearer

378 ADVENT.

"to me than mine own eyes and life." Then follows the letter, in a style of nerve and animation, well suited to the soul- stirring communications he had to make to her about his struggles. One of them was written in the midst of the storm, when the courage- ous Pontiff was besieged in his Basilica by Justina's soldiers. His discourses to the people of Milan, his consolations and his trials, the heroic sentiments of his great soul, all is told in these despatches to his sister, and where every line shows how strong and holy was the attachment between Ambrose and Mar- cellina. The great Basilica of Milan still contains the tomb of the brother and sister : and over them both is daily offered the divine sacrifice.

Such was Ambrose, of whom Theodosius was one day heard to say : " There is but one Bishop in the "world." Let us glorify the Holy Spirit, who has vouchsafed to produce this sublime model in the Church, and let us beg of the holy Pontiff to obtain for us, by his prayers, a share in that lively faith and ardent love which he himself had, and which he evinces in those delicious and eloquent writings, which he has left us on the mystery of the Incarnation. During these days, which are preparing us for the Birth of our Incarnate Lord, Ambrose is one of our most powerful patrons.

His love towards the Blessed Mother of God teaches us what admiration and devotion we ought to have for Mary. St. Ephrem and St. Ambrose are the two Fathers of the fourth century, who are the most explicit upon the glories of the office and the person of the Mother of Jesus. To confine ourselves to St. Ambrose, he has completely mastered this mystery, which he understood, and appreciated, and defined in his writings. Mary's exemption from every stain of sin ; Mary's uniting herself, at the foot of the Cross, with her Divine Son for the salva- tion of the world ; Jesus' appearing, after his resur-

DEC. 7. ST. AMBROSE. 379

rection, to Mary first of all ; — on these and so many other points St. Ambrose has spoken so clearly as to deserve to be considered as one of the most promi- nent witnesses of the primitive traditions respecting the privileges and dignity of the holy Mother of God.

This his devotion to Mary explains St. Ambrose's enthusiastic admiration for the holy state of Chris- tian Virginity, of which he might justly be called the Doctor. He surpasses all the Fathers in the beauti- ful and eloquent manner in which he speaks of the dignity and happiness of Virginity. Four of his writings are devoted to the praises of this sublime state. The Pagans would fain have an imitation of it, by instituting seven Vestal Virgins, whom they loaded with honours and riches, and to whom they in due time restored liberty. St. Ambrose shows how contemptible these were, compared with the innume- rable Virgins of the Christian Church, who filled the whole world with the fragrance of their humility, constancy, and disinterestedness. But on this mag- nificent subject, his words were even more telling than his writings ; and we learn from his contempo- raries, that when he went to preach in any town, mothers would not allow their daughters to be present at his sermon, lest this irresistible panegyrist of the eternal nuptials with the Lamb, should convince them that that was the better part, and persuade them to make it the object of their desires.

But our partiality and devotion to the great Saint of Milan has made us exceed our usual limits : it is time to read the account of his virtues given lis by the Church.

Gaul. It is related that when the saint was an infant, a swarm of bees rested on his lips ; it was a presage of his future extra- ordinary eloquence. He re- ceived a liberal education at Rome, and not long after was appointed, by the Pre- fect Probus, to be Governor of Liguria and Emilia, whence, later on, he was sent, by order of the same Probus, to Milan, with power of Judge ; for the people of that city were quarrelling among them- selves about the successor of the Arian Bishop, Auxen- tius, who had died. Where- fore, Ambrose, having en- tered the Church that he might fulfil the duty that had been imposed on him, and quell the disturbance that had arisen, delivered an eloquent discourse on the advantages of peace and tranquillity in a State. Scarcely had he finished speaking, than a boy ex- claimed : Ambrose, Bishop I The whole multitude shout- ed : Ambrose, Bishop !

On his refusing to accede to their entreaties, the earnest request of the people was presented to the Empe- ror Valentinian, who was gratified that they whom he selected as Judges were thus sought after to be made Priests. It was also pleas- ing to the Prefect Probus, who, as though he foresaw the event, said to Ambrose on his setting out : Go, act

not as Judge, but as Bishop. The desire of the people being thus seconded by the will of the Emperor, Am- brose was baptised (for he was only a catechumen), and was admitted to sacred Orders, ascending by all the degrees of Orders as pre- scribed by the Church ; and on the eighth day, which was the s.venth of the Ides of December (December 7th), he received the burden of the Episcopacy. Being made Bishop, he most strenuously defended the Catholic faith, and ecclesiastical discipline. He converted to the true faith many Arians, and other heretics, among whom was that brightest luminary of the Church, St. Augustine, the spiritual child of Ambrose in Christ Jesus.

When the Emperor Gra- tian was killed by Maximus, he was twice deputed to go to this murderer, and insist on his doing penance for his crime ; which he refusing to do, Ambrose refused to hold communion with him. The Emperor Theodosius having made himself guilty of the massacre at Thessalonica, was forbidden by the Saint to enter the church. On the Emperor's excusing himself by saying that King David had also committed murder and adultery, Ambrose re- plied : Thou hast imitated his sin, now imitate his re- pentance. Upon which, Theo-

Cui, quum ille David quoque regem adulte- rum et homicidam dixisset, respondit Ambrosius : Qui secutus es errantem, sequere pcenitentem. Quare Theo- dosius sibi ab eo impositam publicam pcenitentiam hu- militer egit. Ergo sanctus Episcopus pro Ecclesia Dei maximis laboribus curisque

dosius humbly performed the public penance which the Bishop imposed upon him. The holy Bishop having thus gone through the greatest labours and soli- citudes for God's Church, and having written several admirable books, foretold the day of his death, before even he was taken with his last sickness. Honoratus, the Bishop of Vercelli, was thrice admonished by the voice of God to go to the dying Saint : he went, and administered to him the Sacred Body of our Lord. Ambrose having received it, and placing his hands in the form of the cross, prayed, and yielded his soul up to God, on the vigil of the Nones of April (April 4th), in the year of our Lord 397.

Let us salute this great Doctor in the words which the holy Church addresses to him in the Office of Vespers.

O Doctor optime, Ecclesiae sanctse lumen, beateAmbrosi, divinse legis amator, depre- care pro nobis Filium Dei.

O most admirable Doctor, Light of the holy Church, Blessed Ambrose, lover of the divine law, pray for us to the Son of God.

The Ambrosian Liturgy is not so rich in its praises of St. Ambrose as we might naturally expect it to be. Even the Preface of the Mass is so short and so wanting in any especial allusion to the Saint, that we think it useless to insert it. We will content ourselves with giving two of the Responsaries of the Night Office, the Hymn, and the Collect, which

strikes us as being the finest. With regard to the Hymn, it is well to mention that almost the whole of it is a modern composition, having been, like a great many other Hymns of the Ambrosian Breviary, subjected to very considerable corrections. The ancient Hymn began with the verse Miraculum laudabile ; but is extremely poor both in sentiment and expression.

Prescient of the future, he must have his infant hand honoured with kisses ; and he who had scarce been freed from swathing bands, plays with the fillets of a mitre.

A boy cries out, and Milan would have Ambrose receive the mitre : Ambrose flees from it, but honours ever pursue them that run from them.

At last, the sacred mitre crowns this head where wis- dom sits : the helmet once on, our warrior gives Arius battle.

Unflinching, he fears neither sceptres, nor a haughty em- press ; and when a blood- stained Csesar attempts to enter the church, he closes the doors against him and repels him from the holy spot.

He washes away the sins of Augustine in the heavenly laver of baptism : companion to the martyrs by his faith, he discovers the relics of Martyrs.

The Mozarabic Liturgy has nothing proper on St. Ambrose. The Greeks, on the contrary, honour the memory of the great Bishop of Milan by Hymns replete with the most magnificent praises. We give a few of the most striking passages.

HYMN TO ST. AMBROSE.

{Taken from the Mencea of the Greeks. December 7.)

Thou that didst adorn with twofold virtue the throne of the Prefecture, didst merito- riously fill the throne of the hierarchy on which divine inspiration placed thee: faith- ful steward, therefore, in both dignities, thou hast in- herited a double crown.

Thou didst purify thy soul and body by continency, and labours, and much watching, and intense prayer, O divinely wise one, O vessel of election of our God ! thou wast like to the Apostles, thou didst receive, like them, the gifts of the Holy Ghost.

Thou art the husbandman, that tillest the field, which is open to all men, of faith and doctrine ; thou there sowest the dogmas of truth, for thou art filled with heavenly wis- dom ; and the grain being multiplied, thou distributest to the Church the heavenly bread of the Holy Spirit.

Rome celebrates thy glo- rious deeds, for, bright as a star, thou shootest forth every- where the great blaze of thy miracles. O truly admirable Pontiff !

From the earliest dawn thou didst approach to Christ, richly bright with his rays upon thee : therefore, having reached the divine light, thou enlightenest them that, through the world, honour thee with faith.

Thou didst consecrate thy body and soul to God ; and thy heart, O Father, which was made for great gifts, thou didst fasten to his sweet love, and there it clung in- tensely.

Intrusted with the talent of the Word, thou didst, as a wise and prudent servant, put it out to usury and mul-

And we, too, O Immortal Ambrose, unworthy though we be to take a part in such a choir, we, too, will praise thee ! We will praise the magnificent gifts which our Lord bestowed upon thee. Thou art the Light of the Church and the Salt of the earth by thy heavenly teachings; thou art the vigilant Pastor, the affectionate Father, the unyielding Pontiff; oh ! how must thy heart have loved that Jesus, for whom w7e are now preparing ! With what undaunted courage thou didst, at the risk of thy life, resist thetn that blasphemed this Divine Word ! Well indeed hast thou thereby merited to be made one of the Patrons of the faithful, to lead them, each year, to Him who is their Saviour and their King ! Let, then, a ray of the truth, which filled thy sublime soul whilst here on earth, penetrate even into our hearts ; give us a relish of thy sweet and eloquent writings ; get us a sentiment of devoted love for the Jesus who is so soon to be wuth us Obtain for us, after thy example, to take up his cause with energy, against the enemies of our holy faith, against the spirits of darkness, and against ourselves. Let every- thing yield, let everything be annihilated, let every knee bow, let every heart confess itself conquered, in the presence of Jesus, the eternal Word of the Father, the Son of God, and the Son of Mary, our Redeemer, our Judge, our All.

Glorious Saint ! humble us, as thou didst Theo-

dosius; raise us up again contrite and converted, as thou didst lovingly raise up this thy strayed sheep and carry him back to thy fold. Pray, too, for the Catholic Hierarchy, of which thou wast one of the brightest ornaments. Ask of God, for the Priests and Bishops of his Church, that humble yet inflexible courage, wherewith they should resist the Powers of the world, as often as they abuse the authority which God has put into their hands. Let their face, as our Lord himself speaks, become hard as adamant1 against the enemies of the Church, and may they set themselves as a wall for the house of Israel ;2 may they consider it as the highest privilege, and the greatest- happiness, to be permitted to expose their property, and peace, and life, for the liberty of this holy Spouse of Christ.

Valiant champion of the Truth ! arm thyself with thy scourge, which the Church has given thee as thy emblem ; and drive far from the flock of Christ the wolves of the Arian tribe, which, under various names, are even now prowling round the fold. Let our ears be no longer shocked with the blasphemies of these proud teachers, who presume to scan, judge, approve, and blame, by the measure of their vain conceits, the great God who has given them every- thing they are and have, and who, out of infinite love for his creatures, has deigned to humble himself and become one of ourselves, although knowing that men would make this very condescension an argu- ment for denying that he is God.

Remove our prejudices, O thou great lover of truth ! and crush within us those time-serving and unwise theories, which tend to make us Christians forget that Jesus is the King of this world, and look on the law, which equally protects error and truth, as the perfection of modern systems. May we under-

1 Ezechiel, i. 9. 2 Ibid. xiii. 5.

390 ADVENT.

stand that the rights of the Son of God and his Church do not cease to exist, because the world ceases to acknowledge them ; that to give the same protection to the true religion and to those false doctrines, which men have set up in opposition to the teaching of the Church, is to deny that all potver has been given to Jesus in heaven and on earth; that those scourges which periodically come upon the world are the lessons which Jesus gives to those who trample on the Rights of his Church, Rights which he so justly acquired by dying on the Cross for all mankind ; that, finally, though it be out of our power to restore those Rights to people that have had the misfortune to resign them, yet it is our duty, under pain of being accomplices with those who would not have Jesus reign over them, to acknow- ledge that they are the Rights of the Church.

And lastly, dear Saint, in the midst of the dark clouds which lower over the world, console our holy Mother the Church, who is now but a stranger and pilgrim amidst those nations which were her children, but have now denied her; may she cull the flowers of holy Virginity among the faithful, and may that holy state be the attraction of those fortunate souls who understand how grand is the dignity of being a Spouse of Christ. If, at the very commencement of her ministry, during the ages of persecution, the holy Church could lead countless Virgins to Jesus, may it be so even now in our own age of crime and sen- suality ; may those pure and generous hearts, formed and consecrated to the Lamb by this holy Mother, become more and more numerous ; and so give to her enemies this irresistible proof that she is not barren, as they pretend, and that it is she that alone preserves the world from universal corruption, by leavening it with this angelic purity.

DEC. 7. ST. AMBROSE. 391

Let us consider that last visible preparation for the coming of the Messias : a universal Peace. The din of war is silenced, and the entire world is intent in expectation. " There are three Silences to be con- " sidered/' says St. Bonaventure, in one of his Sermons for Advent : " the first in the days of Noah, after the " deluge had destroyed all sinners ; the second, in " the days of Caesar Augustus, when all nations were "subjected to the empire ; the third will be at the " death of Antichrist, when the Jews shall be con- " verted." O Jesus ! Prince of Peace, thou wiliest that the world shall be in peace, when thou art coming down to dwell in it. Thou didst foretell this by the Psalmist, thy ancestor in the flesh, who, speaking of thee, said : " He shall make wars to cease " even to the end of the earth ; he shall destroy the bow, and break the weapons ; and the shield he " shall burn in the fire."1 And why is this, O Jesus ? It is, that hearts, which thou art to visit, must be silent and attentive. It is that before thou enterest a soul, thou troublest it in thy great mercy, as the world was troubled and agitated before the universal peace ; then thou bringest peace into that soul, and thou takest possession of her. Oh ! come quickly, dear Lord, subdue our rebellious senses, bring low the haughtiness of our spirit, crucify our flesh, rouse our hearts from their sleep : and then may thy entrance into our souls be a feast-day of triumph, as when a conqueror enters a city which he has taken after a long siege. Sweet Jesus, Prince of Peace ! give us peace ; fix thy kingdom so firmly in our hearts, that thou may est reign in us for ever.

December 8. THE IMMACULATE CONCEPTION

OF THE MOST BLESSED VIRGIN.

At length, on the distant horizon, rises, with a soft and radiant light, the aurora of the Sun which has been so long desired. The happy Mother of the Messias was to be born before the Messias himself; and this is the day of the Conception of Mary. The earth already possesses a first pledge of the divine mercy ; the Son of Man is near at hand. Two true Israelites, Joachim and Anne, noble branches of the family of David, find their union, after a long barren- ness, made fruitful by the divine omnipotence. Glory be to God, who has been mindful of his promises, and who deigns to announce, from the high heavens, the end of the deluge of iniquity, by sending upon the earth the sweet white Dove that bears the tidings of peace !

The Feast of the Blessed Virgin's Immaculate Con- ception is the most solemn of all those which the Church celebrates during the holy time of Advent ; and if the first part of the Cycle had to offer us the commemoration of some one of the Mysteries of Mary, there was none whose object could better harmonise with the spirit of the Church in this mystic season of expectation. Let us, then, celebrate this solemnity with joy; for the Conception of Mary tells us that the Birth of Jesus is not far off.

The intention of the Church, in this Feast, is not only to celebrate the anniversary of the happy moment in which began, in the womb of the pious

394 ADVENT.

Anne, the life of the ever-glorious Virgin Mary ; but also to honour the sublime privilege, by which Mary was preserved from the original stain, which, by a sovereign and universal decree, is contracted by all the children of Adam the very moment they are conceived in their mother's womb. The faith of the Catholic Church on the subject of the Conception of Mary is this : that at the very instant, when God united the Soul of Mary, which he had created, to the Body which it was to animate, this ever-blessed Soul did not only not contract the stain, which, at that same instant, denies every human soul, but was filled with an immeasurable grace which rendered her, from that moment, the mirror Of the sanctity of God himself, as far as this is possible to a creature. The Church, with her infallible authority, declared, by the lips of Pius the Ninth, that this article of her faith had been revealed by God himself. The De- finition was received with enthusiasm by the whole of Christendom, and the Eighth of December of the year 1854 was thus made one of the most memorable days of the Church's history.

It was due to his own infinite sanctity that God should suspend, in this instance, the law which his divine justice had passed upon all the children of Adam. The relations which Mary was to bear to the Divinity, could not be reconciled with her undergoing the humiliation of this punishment. She was not only Daughter of the Eternal Father ; she was des- tined also to become the very Mother of the Son, and the veritable Spouse of the Holy Ghost; nothing defiled could be permitted to enter, even for an atom of time, into the creature that was thus predestined to contract such close relations with the adorable Trinity; not a speck could be permitted to tarnish in Mary that perfect purity which the infinitely holy God requires in those who are one day to be admitted to enjoy even the sight of his divine majesty in

DEC. 8. THE IMMACULATE CONCEPTION. 395

heaven ; in a word, as the great Doctor St. Anselm says, " it was just that this Holy Virgin should be " adorned with the greatest 'purity which can be con- " ceived after that of God himself, since God the Fa- "ther was to give to her, as her Child, that only " Begotten Son, whom he loved as himself, as being " begotten to him from his own bosom ; and this in " such a manner, that the self-same Son of God was, " by nature, the Son of both God the Father and of " this Blessed Virgin. This same Son chose her to be " substantially his Mother ; and the Holy Ghost " willed that in Sfer wombfie would operate the con- " ception and birth of Him, from whom he himself " proceeded."1

Moreover, the close ties which were to unite the Son of God with Mary, and which would elicit from him the tenderest love and the most filial reverence for her, had been present to the divine thought from all eternity : and the conclusion forces itself upon us, that, therefore, the Divine Word had for this his future Mother a love infinitely greater than that which he bore for all his other creatures. Mary's honour was infinitely dear to him, because she w^as to be his Mother, chosen to be so by his eternal and merciful decrees. The Son's love protected the Mo- ther. She, indeed, in her sublime humility, willingly submitted to whatever the rest of God's creatures had brought on themselves, and obeyed every tittle of those laws which were never meant for her : but that humiliating barrier, which confronts every child of Adam at the first moment of his existence, and keeps him from light and grace until he shall have been re- generated by a new birth, — oh ! this could not be permitted to stand in Mary's way, — her Son forbade it.

The Eternal Father would not do less for the Second Eve than he had done for the First ; yet she

1 De Conceptu Virginali, Cap. xviii.

396 ADVENT.

was created, as was also the first Adam, in the state of original justice, which she afterwards forfeited by sin. The Son of God would not permit that the Woman, from whom he was to take the nature of Man, should be deprived of that gift which he had given even to her who was the mother of sin. The Holy Ghost, who was to overshadow Mary and pro- duce Jesus within her by his divine operation, would not permit that foul stain, in which we are all con- ceived, to rest, even for an instant, on this his Spouse. All men were to contract the sin of Adam ; the sen- tence was universal ; but God's own Mother is not included. God, who is the author of that law ; God, who was free to make it as he willed ; had power to exclude from it Her whom he had predestined to be his Own in so many ways ; he could exempt her, and it was just that he should exempt her ; therefore, he did it.

Was ifc not this grand exemption which God him- self foretold, when the guilty pair, whose children we all are, appeared before him in the garden of Eden \ In the anathema which fell upon the serpent, there was included a promise of mercy to us. / will put enmities, said the Lord, between thee and the Wo- man, and thy seed and her seed : she shall crush thy head} Thus was salvation promised the hu- man race under the form of a victory over Satan ; and this victory is to be gained by the Woman, and she will gain it for us also. Even granting, as some read this text, that it is the Son of the Woman that is alone to gain this victory, the enmity between the Woman and the Serpent is clearly expressed, and she, the Woman, with her own foot, is to crush the headoi the hated Serpent. The Second Eve is to be worthy of the Second Adam, conquering and not to be con- quered. The human race is one day to be avenged,

1 Gen. iii. 15.

DEC. 8. THE IMMACULATE CONCEPTION. 397

not only by God made Man, but also by the Woman miraculously exempted from every stain of sin, in whom the primaeval creation, which was in justice and holiness,1 will thus reappear in her, just as though the original sin had never been committed.

Raise up your heads, then, ye children of Adam, and shake off your chains ! This day, the humiliation, which weighed you down, is annihilated. Behold ! Mary, she who is of the same flesh and blood as your- selves, has seen the torrent of sin, which swept along all the generations of mankind, she has seen it flow back at her presence and not touch her ; the infernal dragon has turned away his head, daring not to breathe his venom upon her; the dignity of your origin is given to her in all its primitive grandeur. This happy day, then, on which the original purity of your race is renewed, must be a Feast to you. The Second Eve is created, and from her own blood, (which, with the exception of the element of sin, is the same as that which makes you to be the children of Adam,) she is shortly to give you the God-Man, who proceeds from her according to the flesh, as he proceeds from the Father according to the eternal generation.

And how can we do less than admire and love the incomparable purity of Mary in her Immaculate Conception, when we hear even that God, who thus prepared her to become his Mother, saying to her, in the divine Canticle, these words of complacent love : Thou art all fair, 0 my Love ! and there is not a spot in thee P It is the God of all-holiness that here speaks ; that eye, which sees all things, finds not a vestige, not a shadow of sin ; therefore does he delight in her, and admire in her that gift of his own condescending munificence. We cannot be surprised after this, that Gabriel, when he came down from heaven to announce the Incarnation to her, is full

iEph. iv. 24. 2Cant. iv. 7.

398 ADVENT.

of admiration at the sight of that purity, whose beginning was so glorious and whose progress was immeasurable ; and that this blessed Spirit should bow down profoundly before this young Maid of Nazareth, and salute her with, " Hail, 0 Full of Grace !" 1 And who is this Gabriel ? An Arch- angel, that lives amidst the grandest magnificences of God's creation, amidst all the gorgeous riches of heaven ; who is Brother to the Cherubim and Sera- phim, to the Thrones and Dominations ; whose eye is accustomed to gaze on those nine angelic choirs with their dazzling brightness of countless degrees of light and grace ; he has found on earth, in a creature of a nature below that of Angels, the fulness of grace, of that grace which had been given to the Angels measuredly. This fulness of grace was in Mary from the very first instant of her existence. She is the future Mother of God, and she was ever holy, ever pure, ever Immaculate.

This truth of Mary's Immaculate Conception, which was revealed to the Apostles by the divine Son of Mary, inherited by the Church, taught by the Holy Fathers, believed by each generation of the Christian people with an ever increasing explicitness, this truth, we say, was implied in the very notion of a Mother of God. To believe that Mary was Mother of God, was an implicitly believing that she, on whom this sublime dignity was conferred, had never been defiled with the slightest stain of sin, and that God had bestowed upon her an absolute exemption from sin. But now, the Immaculate Conception of Mary rests on an explicit Definition dictated by the Holy Ghost. Peter has spoken by the mouth of Pius ; and when Peter has spoken, every Christian should believe ; for the Son of God has said : / have prayed for thee, Peter, that thy faith fail not.2 And again: The

1 St. Luke, i. 28. £ St. Luke, xxii. 32.

DEC. 8. THE IMMACULATE CONCEPTION. 399

Holy Ghost, whom the Father will send in my name, he will teach you all things, and bring all things to your mind, ivhatsoever I shall have said to you}

The Symbol of our faith has therefore received not a new truth, but a new light on a truth which was previously the object of the universal belief. On that great day of the Definition, the infernal serpent was again crushed beneath the victorious foot of the Virgin-Mother, and the Lord graciously gave us the strongest pledge of his mercy. He still loves this guilty earth, since he has deigned to en- lighten it with one of the brightest rays of his Mother's glory. How this earth of ours exulted ! The present generation will never forget the en- thusiasm with which the entire universe received the tidings of the Definition. It was an event of mysterious importance which thus marked this second half of our century ; and we shall look forward to the future with renewed confidence ; for if the Holy Ghost bids us tremble for the days when Truths are diminished among the children of men,2 he would, consequently, have us look on those times as blessed by God in which we receive an increase of truth ; an increase both in light and in authority.

The Church, even before the solemn proclamation of the grand dogma, kept the Feast of this 8th day of December ; which was, in reality, a profession of her faith. It is true, that the Feast was not called the Immaculate Conception, but simply the Conception of Mary. But the fact of such a Feast being insti- tuted and kept, was an unmistakable expression of the faith of Christendom in that truth. St. Bernard and the Angelical Doctor, St. Thomas, both teach that the Church cannot celebrate the Feast of what is not holy ; the Conception of Mary, therefore, was

1 St. John, xiv. 26. a Ps. xi. 2.

400 ADVENT.

holy and immaculate, since the Church has, for ages past, honoured it with a special Feast. The Nativity of the same holy Virgin is kept as a solemnity in the Church, because Mary was born full of grace ; there- fore, had the first moment of Mary's existence been one of sin, as is that of all the other children of Adam, it never could have been made the subject of the reverence of the Church. Now, there are few Feasts so generally and so firmly established in the Church as this which we are keeping to-day.

The Greek Church, which, more easily than the Latin, could learn what were the pious traditions of the East, kept this feast even in the sixth century, as is evident from the ceremonial or, as it was called, the Type, of St. Sabas. In the West, we find it established in the Gothic Church of Spain as far back as the eighth century. A celebrated calendar which was engraved on marble, in the ninth century, for the use of the Church of Naples, attests that it had already been introduced there. Paul, the Deacon, Secretary to the Emperor Charlemagne, and after- wards Monk at Monte-Cassino, composed a celebrated Hymn on the mystery of the Immaculate Conception; we will insert this piece later on, as it is given in the manuscript copies of Monte-Cassino and Benevento. In 10G6, the Feast was first established in England, in consequence of the pious Abbot Helsyn's1 being miraculously preserved from shipwreck ; and shortly after that, was made general through the whole Island by the zeal of the great St. Anselm, Monk of the Order of St. Benedict, and Archbishop of Canter- bury. From England it passed into Normandy, and took root in France. We find it sanctioned in Germany, in a council held in 1049, at which St. Leo IX. was present; in Navarre, 1090, at the

DEC. 8. THE IMMACULATE CONCEPTION. 401

Abbey of Irach; in Belgium, at Liege, in 1142. Thus did the Churches of the West testify their faith in this mystery, by accepting its Feast, which is the expression of faith.

Lastly, it was adopted by Rome herself, and her doing so rendered the united testimony of her chil- dren.— the other Churches, — more imposing than ever. It was Pope Sixtus IY. who, in the year 1476, published the decree of the feast of Our Lady's Con- ception for the City of St. Peter. In the next century, 1568, 'St. Pius V. published the universal edition of the Roman Breviary, and in its Calendar was inserted this feast as one of those Christian solemnities, which the faithful are every year bound to observe. It was not from Rome that the devotion of the Catholic world to this mystery received its first impulse; she sanctioned it by her liturgical authority, just as she confirmed it by her doctrinal authority, in these Our own days.

The three great Catholic Nations of Europe, — Ger- many, France, and Spain, — vied with each other in their devotion to this mystery of Mary's Immaculate Conception. France, by her King Louis XIV., obtained from Clement IX. that this feast should be kept with an Octave throughout the kingdom; which favour was afterwards extended to the universal Church by Innocent XII. For centuries previous to this, the Theological Faculty of Paris had always exacted from its Professors the oath that they would defend this privilege of Mary ; a pious practice which continued as long as the University itself.

As regards Germany, the Emperor Ferdinand III., in 1647, ordered a splendid monument to be erected in the great square of Vienna. It is covered with emblems and figures symbolical of Mary's victory over sin, and on the top is the statue of the Imma- culate Queen, with this solemn and truly Catholic inscription :

But the zeal of Spain for the privilege of the holy Mother of God surpassed that of all other nations. In the year 1398, John I. King of Arragon, issued a Chart, in which he solemnly places his person and kingdom under the protection of Mary Immaculate Later on, Kings Philip III. and Philip IV. sent ambassadors to Rome, soliciting, in their names, the solemn definition, which heaven reserved, in its mercy, for our days. King Charles III. in the last century, obtained permission from Clement XIII., that the Immaculate Conception should be the patronal feast of Spain. The people of Spain, so

justly called the Catholic Kingdom, put over the door, or on the front of their houses, a tablet with the words of Mary's privilege written on it ; and when they meet, they greet each other with an ex- pression in honour of the same dear mystery. It was a Spanish Nun, Mary of Jesus, Abbess of the Convent of the Immaculate Conception of Agreda, who wrote God's Mystic City, which inspired Murillo with his Immaculate Conception, the master-piece of the Spanish School.

But, whilst thus mentioning the different nations which have been foremost in their zeal for this article of our holy faith, the Immaculate Conception, — it were unjust to pass over the immense share which the Seraphic Order, the Order of St. Francis of Assisi, has had in the earthly triumph of our Blessed Mother, the Queen of heaven and earth. As often as this feast comes round, is it not just that we should think with reverence and gratitude on him, who was the first theologian that showed how closely connected with the divine mystery of the Incarnation is this dogma of the Immaculate Conception ? First, then, all honour to the name of the pious and learned John Duns Scotus ! And when at length the great day of the Definition of the Immaculate Conception came, how justly merited was that grand audience, which the Vicar of Christ granted to the Franciscan Order, and with which closed the pageant of the glorious solemnity ! Pius the Ninth received from the hands of the children of St. Francis a tribute of homage and thankfulness, which the Scotist School, after having fought four hundred years in defence of Mary's Immaculate Conception, now presented to the Pontiff.

In the presence of the fifty-four Cardinals, forty- two Archbishops, and ninety-two Bishops ; before an immense concourse of people that filled Saint Peter's, and had united in prayer, begging the assistance of

404 ADVENT.

the Spirit of Truth ; the Vicar of Christ had just pronounced the decision which so many ages had hoped to hear. The Pontiff had offered the Holy Sacrifice on the Confession of Saint Peter. He had crowned the Statue of the Immaculate Queen with a splendid diadem. Carried on his lofty throne, and wearing his triple crown, he had reached the portico of the basilica ; there he is met by the two represen- tatives of St. Francis : they prostrate before the throne : the triumphal procession halts : and first, there advances the General of the Friars Minor Obser- vantines; he presents to the Holy Father a branch of silver Lilies : he was followed by the General of the Conventual Friars, holding in his hand a branch of silver Poses. ■ The Pope graciously accepted both. The Lilies and the Poses were S3^mbolical of Mary's purity and love ; the whiteness of the silver was the emblem of the lovely brightness of that orb, on which is reflected the light of the Sun ; for, as the Canticle says of Mary, " she is beautiful as the Moon."1 The Pontiff was overcome with emotion at these gifts of the family of the Seraphic Patriarch, to which we might justly apply what was said of the Banner of the Maid of Orleans: "It had stood the brunt of the battle; " it deserved to share in the glory of the victory." And thus ended the glories of that grand morning of the Eighth of December, Eighteen-hundred and Fifty-four. It is thus, O thou the humblest of creatures, that thy Immaculate Conception has been glorified on earth ! And how could it be else than a great joy to men, that thou art honoured by them, thou the aurora of the Sun of Justice ? Dost thou not bring them the tidings of their salvation ? Art not thou, O Mary, that bright ray of hope, which suddenly bursts forth in the deep abyss of the world's misery ? What should we have been without Jesus? and thou art his dearest Mother, the holiest of God's creatures,

1 Cant. vi. 9.

DEC. 8. THE IMMACULATE CONCEPTION. 405

the purest of virgins, and our own most loving Mother !

How thy gentle light gladdens our wearied eyes, sweet Mother ! Generation had followed generation on this earth of ours. Men looked up to heaven through their tears, hoping to see appear on the horizon the Star, which they had been told should disperse the gloomy horrors of the world's darkness ; but death came, and they sank into the tomb, with- out seeing even the dawn of the Light, for which alone they cared to live. It was for us that God had reserved the blessing of seeing thy lovely rising, O thou fair Morning Star ! which sheddest thy blessed rays on the sea, and bringest calm after the long stormy night ! Oh ! prepare our eyes that they may behold the divine Sun which will soon follow in thy path, and give to the world his reign of light and day. Prepare our hearts, for it is to our hearts that this Jesus of thine wishes to show himself. To see him, our hearts must be pure ; purify them, thou O Immaculate Mother ! The divine wisdom has willed that of the feasts which the Church dedicates to thee, this of thy Immaculate Conception should be celebrated during Advent ; that thus the children of the Church, reflecting on the jealous care wherewith God preserved thee from every stain of sin, because thou wast to be the Mother of his divine Son, — might prepare to receive this same Jesus by the most perfect renouncing of every sin and every attachment to sin. This great change must be made ; and thy prayers, O Mary ! will help us to make it. Pray, we ask it of thee by the grace God gave thee in thy Immaculate Conception, that our covetousness may be destroyed, our concupiscence extinguished, and our pride turned into humility. Despise not our prayers, dear Mother of that Jesus who chose thee for his dwelling-place, that he might afterwards find one in each of us.

406 ADVENT.

O Mary ! Ark of the Covenant, built of an incor- ruptible wood, and covered over with the purest gold ! help us to correspond with those wonderful designs of our God, who, after havirjg found his glory in thy incomparable purity, wills now to seek his glory in our unworthiness, by making us, from being slaves of the devil, his temples and his abode, where he may find his delight. Help us to this, O thou that by the mercy of thy Son hast never known sin ! and receive this day our devoutest praise. Thou art the Ark of Salvation ; the one creature unwrecked in the universal deluge ; the white Fleece filled with the dew of heaven, whilst the earth around is parched ; the Flame which the many waters could not quench ; the Lily blooming amidst thorns ; the Garden shut against the infernal serpent; the Fountain sealed, whose limpid water was never ruffled ; the House of the Lord, whereon his eyes were ever fixed, and into which nothing defiled could ever enter ; the mystic City, of which such glorious things are said.1 We delight in telling all thy glorious titles, O Mary ! for thou art our Mother, and we love thee, and the Mother's glory is the glory of her children. Cease not to bless and protect all them that honour thy immense privilege, 0 thou that wast conceived on this day ! May this feast fit us for that mystery, for which thy Conception, thy Birth, and thy Annuncia- tion, are all preparations, — the Birth of thy Jesus in Bethlehem : yea, dear Mother, we desire thy Jesus, — give him to us and satisfy the longings of our love.

FIRST VESPERS.

The five Psalms which are chanted by the Church in this Office, are the ones which she always employs on the feasts of our Lady.

1 Ps. lxxxvi. 3.

DEC. 8. THE IMMACULATE CONCEPTION. 407

The first celebrates the Royalty, the Priesthood, and the supreme Judge- ship of Christ, the Son of God and the Son of Mary ; it implies, therefore, the great dignity, and the incomparable purity of Her that was to give him birth.

Antiphon. Thou art all fair, 0 Mary, and the stain original is not in thee.

Antiphona. Tota pulchra es, Maria, et macula origi- nalis non est in te.

PSALM 109.

The Lord said to my Lord, his Son : Sit thou at my right hand, and reign with me.

Until I make thy enemies thy footstool.

0 Christ ! the Lord, thy Father, will send forth the sceptre of thy power out of Sion : from thence rule thou in the midst of thy enemies.

With thee is the princi- pality in the day of thy strength, in the brightness of the saints : for the Father hath said to thee : From the womb before the day-star I begot thee.

The Lord hath sworn, and he will not repent : he hath said, speaking of thee, the God-Man : Thou art a Priest for ever, according to the order of Melchisedech.

Therefore, 0 Father, the Lord thy Son is at thy right hand : he hath broken kings in the day of his wrath.

He shall also judge among nations ; in that terrible coming, he shall fill the ruins of the world ; he shall crush the heads in the land of many.

Dixit Dominus Domino meo : * Sede a dextris meis.

Donee ponam inimicos tuos : * scabellum pedum tuorum.

Virgam virtutis tuse emit- tet Dominus ex Sion : * do- minare in medio inimicorum tuorum.

Ant. Thou art all fair, O Mary, and the stain original is not in thee.

Ant. Thy garment is white as snow, and thy face is as the sun.

The second Psalm celebrates the greatness of God, yet shows him to us as looking down with com- placency on the humble of heart. It was the hu- mility of Mary which made him choose her for his own Mother, and crown her as the Queen of the universe. She ever remained a pure Virgin, and yet our Lord made her to be Mother of all mankind.

PSALM 112.

Laudate, pueri, Domi- num : * laudate Women Do- mini.

Ant. Vestimentum tuum candidum quasi nix, et f acies tua sicut sol.

Ant. Tu gloria Jerusalem, tu Isetitia Israel, tu honorih- centia populi nostri.

The third Psalm sings the glory of Jerusalem, the City of God. Mary, who was the dwelling which the Most High had chosen for himself, was signified by this blessed City. It is in her, in the admiration which her dignity excites, and in the confidence which her exhaustless love inspires, that the chil- dren of the Church are now assembled. The Church herself is also the city of God.

PSALM 121.

I rejoiced at the things that were said to me : We shall go into the house of the Lord.

Our feet were standing in thy courts, O Jerusalem ! Our heart loves and confides in thee, 0 Mary.

Mary is like to Jerusalem that is built as a City ; which is compact together.

For thither did the tribes go up, the tribes of the Lord : the testimony of Israel, to praise the Name of the Lord.

Because seats sat there in judgment ; seats upon the house of David ; and Mary is of a kingly race.

Pray ye, through Mary, for the things that are for the peace of Jerusalem : and may abundance be on them that love thee, 0 Church of our God !

The voice of Mary : Let peace be in thy strength, 0 thou new Sion ! and abun- dance in thy towers.

I, a daughter of Israel, for the sake of my brethren and of my neighbours, spoke peace of thee.

Because of the house of the Lord our God, I have sought good things for thee.

Ant. Thou art the glory of Jerusalem, thou art the joy of Israel, thou art the honour of our people.

Ant. Blessed art thou, O Virgin Mary, by the Lord the most high God, above all women upon the earth.

The following Psalm is inserted in the Office of our Lady, on account of the allusion made in it to a House which God himself has built, and to a City of which he is the guardian. Mary is this House, which God built for himself; she is this City, which he has protected from every insult and attack.

PSALM 126.

Nisi Dominus sedificaverit domum : * in vanum labora- verunt qui aedificant earn.

Nisi Dominus custodierit civitatem : * frustra vigilat qui custodit earn.

Vanum est vobis ante lu- cem surgere : * surgite post quam sederitis, qui mandu- catis panem doloris.

Unless the Lord build the House, they labour in vain that build it.

Unless the Lord keep the City, he watcheth in vain that keepeth it.

It is vain for you to rise before light ; rise ye after you have sitten, you that eat of the bread of sorrow.

Again, it is Mary, the mystic City of God, that the Church has in view when she sings, on these feasts, the following beautiful Psalm. On this day of her Conception, our Lord strengthened the gates of his beloved City; the enemy could not enter. God owed this defence to Her, by whom he intended to send his Word upon the earth.

PSALM 147.

The Capitulum is a passage from the Book of Proverbs of Solomon, in which Divine Wisdom, the Son of God, publishes the eternity of the divine decree of the Incarnation. The Church, on this day, puts these same in the mouth of Mary, inasmuch as this privileged creature was also decreed, before all time, to be the Mother of the Man-God.

The Introit is a soDg of thanksgiving, taken from Isaias and the Psalms. Mary extols the wonderful gifts of God to her, and the victory which he has granted her over Satan and sin.

INTROIT.

I will rejoice with exceed- ing joy in the Lord, and my sonl shall exult in my God : for he hath clothed me with the garments of salvation ; and with the robe of justice he hath covered me, as a bride adorned with her jewels.

Ps. I will extol thee, O Lord, for thou hast upheld me : and hast not made my enemies to rejoice over me. Glory be to the Father, dtc. I will rejoice, &c.

Gaudens gaudebo in Do- mino, et exsultabit anima rnea in Deo meo : quia induit me vestimentis salutis ; et indimiento justitiae circum- dedit me, quasi sponsam or- natam monihbus suis.

Ps. Exaltabo te, Domine, quoniam suscepisti me : nee delectasti inimicos meos su- per me. Gloria Patri. Gau- dens gaudebo.

The Collect gives us the moral explanation of the mystery. Mary was preserved from original sin be- cause she was to be the dwelling-place of the Most Holy : let this teach us to beg of this same God, that he would purify our souls.

Lesson from the Book of Wisdom.

Prov. Ch. VIII. The Lord possessed me in the beginning of his ways, before he made anything from the beginning. I was set up from eternity, and of old before the earth was made. The depths were not as yet, and I was already conceived : neither had the fountains of waters as yet sprung out ; the mountains with their huge bulk had not as yet been es- tablished : before the hills I was brought forth : he had not yet made the earth, nor the rivers, nor the poles of the world. When he pre- pared the heavens, I was pre- sent : when with a certain law and compass he enclosed the depths : when he estab- lished the sky above, and poised the fountains of wa- ters : when he compassed the sea with its bounds and set a law to the waters, that they should not pass their limits : when he balanced the founda- tions of the earth : I was with him forming all things : and was delighted every day, play- ing before him at all times, playing in the world : and my delights were to be with the children of men. Now, there- fore, ye children, hear me. Blessed are they that keep my ways. Hear instruction

The Apostle teaches us that Jesus, our Emmanuel, is the first bom of every creature} These mysterious words signify not only that he is, as God, eternally begotten of the Father ; but also that the Divine Word is, as Man, anterior to all created beings. Yet, how is this? the world had been created, and the human race had dwelt on this earth full four thousand years, before the Son of God took to himself the na- ture of man. We answer, that it is not in the order of time, but in the eternal intention of God, that the Man-God preceded every creature. The Eternal Fa- ther decreed first to give to his Eternal Son a created nature, namely, the nature of man, and, in conse- quence of this decree, to create all beings, whether spiritual or material, as a kingdom for this Man-God. This explains to us how it is, that the divine Wisdom, the Son of God, in the passage of the sacred Scripture which forms the Epistle of this Feast, proclaims his having existed before all the creatures of the universe. As God, he was begotten from all eternity in the bosom of the Father ; as Man, he was, in the mind of God, the type of all creatures, before those creatures were made. But the Son of God could not be of our race, as the divine will decreed he should be, unless he were born in time, and born of a Mother as other men ; and therefore She that was to be his Mother was eternally present to the thought of God, as the means whereby the Word would assume the human nature. The Son and the Mother are therefore united

in the plan of the Incarnation : Mary, therefore, existed, as did Jesus, in the divine decree, before cre- ation began. This is the reason of the Church's hav- ing, from the earliest ages of Christianity, interpreted this sublime passage of the sacred volume of Jesus and of Mary unitedly, and ordering it and analogous passages of the Scriptures to be read in the assembly of the faithful on the solemnities or feasts of the Mother of God. But if Mary be thus prominent in the divine and eternal plan ; if, in the sense in which these mysterious texts are understood by the Church, she was, with Jesus, before every creature ; could God permit her to be subjected to the original sin, which was to fall on all the children of Adam ? She is, it is true, to be a child of Adam like her divine Son himself, and to be born at the time fixed ; but God's grace shall turn away from her that torrent, which sweeps all mankind along ; it shall not come near to her, and she shall transmit to her Son, who was also the Son of God, the human nature in its original per- fection, created, as the Apostle says, in holiness and justice.1

The Gradual is the application to the Immaculate Mother of God of those praises with which the ancients of Bethulia greeted Judith, after she had slain the enemy of God's people. Judith is one of the types of Mary, who crushed the head of the serpent.

The alleluia verse applies to our Blessed Lady those words of the divine Canticle, which proclaim the Spouse of God to be all fair and spotless.

GOSPEL.

The following from the holy Gospel according to Luke.

Cfo I.

At that time the Angel Gabriel was sent from God into a city of Galilee, called Nazareth, to a Virgin es- poused to a man whose name was Joseph, of the house of David : and the Virgin's name was Mary. And the Angel being come in, said unto her : Hail, full of grace ; the Lord is with thee : blessed art thou among

Sequentia sancti Evangelii secundum Lucam.

Cap, 1.

In illo tempore : Missus est Angelus Gabriel a Deo in civitatem Galilseas, cui nomen Nazareth, ad Virginem des- ponsatam viro, cui nomen erat Joseph, de domo David : et nomen Virginis, Maria. Et ingressus Angelus ad earn, dixit : Ave, gratia plena ; Dominus tecum : benedicta tu in mulieribus.

This is the salutation with which the Archangel greets Mary. It shows us what was his admiration and hisprofound veneration for the Virgin of Nazareth. The holy Gospel tells us that Mary was troubled at these words, and thought within herself what such a salutation as this could imply. The Sacred Scrip- tures record many Angelical salutations : but, as St. Ambrose, St. Andrew of Crete, and, before them, Origen, had remarked, there is not one which con- tains such praises as this does. The prudent Virgin was, therefore, naturally surprised at the extraordinary words of the Angel, and, as the early Fathers observe, they would remind her of that other interview be- tween Eve and the serpent. She therefore remained

420 ADVENT.

silent, and it was only after the Archangel had spoken to her a second time, that she made him a reply.

And yet, Gabriel had spoken not only with all the eloquence, but with all the profound wisdom of a celestial Spirit initiated into the divine mysteries ; and, in his own superhuman language, he announced that the moment had come when Eve was to be transformed into Mary. There was present before him a woman destined for the sublimest dignity, the woman that was to be the Mother of God; yet, up to this solemn moment, Mary was but a daughter of the human race. Think, then, taking Gabriel's words as your guide, what must have been the holiness of Mary in this her first estate : is it not evident, that the prophecy, made in the earthly paradise, had already been accomplished in Her ?

The Archangel proclaims her Full of Grace. What means this, but that the second Woman possesses in herself that element of which sin had deprived the first ? And observe, he does not say merely that divine grace works in her, but that she is full of it. "She is not merely in grace as others "■ are," as Saint Peter Chrysologus told us on his feast, "but she is filled with it." Everything in Her is resplendent with heavenly purity, and sin has never cast its shadow on her beauty. To appreciate the full import of Gabriel's expression, we must con- sider what is the force of the words in the language which the sacred historian used. Grammarians tell us, that the single word which he employs is much more comprehensive than our expression " full of " grace." It implies not only the present time, but the past as well, — an incorporation of grace from the very commencement, — the full and complete affirma- tion of grace, — the total permanence of grace. Our translation has unavoidably weakened the term.

The better to feel the full force of our translation, let us compare this with an analogous text from the

DEC. 8. THE IMMACULATE CONCEPTION. 421

Gospel of St. John. This Evangelist, speaking of the Humanity of the Incarnate Word, expresses all by saying, that Jesus is full of grace and truth.1 Now, would this fulness have been real, had sin ever been there, instead of grace, even for a single iustant ? Could we call him full of grace, who had once stood in need of being cleansed ? Undoubtedly, we must ever respectfully bear in mind the distance between the Humanity of the Incarnate Word and the person of Mary, from whose womb the Son of God assumed that Humanity ; but the sacred text obliges us to confess, that the fulness of grace was, proportionately, in both Jesus and Mary.

Gabriel goes on still enumerating the supernatural riches of Mary. He says to her : " the Lord is with |; thee." What means this 1 It means, that even before Mary had conceived our Lord in her chaste womb, she already possessed him in her soul. But, would the words be true, if that union with God had once not been, and had only begun when her dis- union with him by sin had been removed % The solemn occasion, on which the Angel uses this lan- guage, forbids us to think that he conveyed by it any other idea, than that she had always had the Lord with her. We feel the allusion to a contrast between the First and the Second Eve; the First lost the God who had once been with her ; the Second had, like the First, received our Lord into her from the first moment of her existence, and never lost him, but continued from first to last and for ever to have him with her.

Let us listen once more to the salutation, and we shall find from its last words that Gabriel is an- nouncing the fulfilment of the divine oracle, and is addressing Mary as the woman foretold to be the instrument of the victory over Satan. " Blessed art

1 St. John, i. 14.

422 ADVENT.

" thou among women." For four thousand years, every woman has been under the curse of God, and has brought forth her children in suffering and sorrow : but here is the one among women, that has been ever blessed of God, that has ever been the enemy of the serpent, and that shall bring forth the fruit of her womb without travail.

The Immaculate Conception of Mary is therefore declared in the Archangel's salutation ; and we can now understand, why the Church selected this portion of the Gospel to be read to-day in the assembly of the faithful.

DEC. 8. THE IMMACULATE CONCEPTION. 423

PKEFACE.

The Church is too full of the joy of this great feast to be satisfied with her usual form of Thanks- giving ; she employs one which makes mention of the Holy Mother of God, whose Conception revives her hopes, and announces the rising of Him who is the Eternal Light.

It is truly meet and just, right and available to salva- tion, that we should always, and jn all places, give thanks to thee, 0 holy Lord, Father almighty, eternal God : And that we should praise, bless, and glorify thee on the Im- maculate Conception of the Blessed Mary, ever a Virgin, who by the overshadowing of the Holy Ghost conceived thine Only Begotten Son, and, the glory of her virginity still remaining, brought forth the eternal Light to the world, Jesus Christ our Lord. By whom the Angels praise thy majesty, the Dominations adore it, the Powers tremble before it, the Heavens, the heavenly Virtues, and blessed Seraphim, with common ju- bilee glorify it. Together with whom we beseech thee that we may be admitted to join our humble voices, say- ing : Holy ! Holy I Holy !

Vere dignum et jus turn est, sequum et salutare, nos tibi semper, et ubique gra- tias agere : Domine sancte, Pater omnipotens, seterne Deus : Et te in Conceptione Immaculata beatse Mariae semper Virginis collaudare, benedicere, et prsedicare. Quae et Unigenitum tuum Sancti Spiritus obumbra- tione concepit : et virgini- tatis gloria permanente, Lu- men seternum mundo effu- dit, Jesum Christum Domi- num nostrum. Per quern Majestatem tuam laudant Angeli, adorant Domina- tiones, tremunt Potestates. Cceli, ccelorumque Virtutes, ac beata Seraphim, socia ex- sultatione concelebrant. Cum quibus et nostras voces, ut admitti jubeas, deprecamur, supplici confessione dicen- tes : Sanctus I Sanctus ! Sanctus !

During the Communion, the Church shares in the holy enthusiasm, wherewith David proclaims the glories and the privileges of the mystic City of God.

DEC. 8. THE IMMACULATE CONCEPTION. 425

We will now give three liturgical Hymns com- posed in honour of the Mystery of Mary's Immacu- late Conception ; they will assist the faithful to enter more fully into the spirit of to-day's feast. "We must give the precedence to the beautiful strophes, in which Prudentius, in his Hymn Ante cibum, celebrates the triumph of the Woman over the serpent. We find, then, early in the 5th century, that the prince of Christian poets mentions, as one of the glories of Mary, her having triumphed over all the poisons of the infernal dragon, because there was to be bestowed upon her the dignity of Mother of God.

HYMN.

Lo ! there comes a new progeny : a new Man come from heaven, not formed of clay as was that first Adam ; no, it is God himself that has assumed human nature, though without that nature's sins.

The Word of the Father is made living flesh ■ a spot- less Virgin is his Mother, not made so by the ordinary laws of wedlock, but by the overshadowing of that bright Spirit, who is God, yet chooses Mary for his Spouse.

Here is the cause of that ancient hate, that ever-war- ring quarrel between the serpent and man, — that now the crouching viper is crushed by the Woman's foot.

The Virgin, that was made worthy to be Mother of God, triumphs over all the poisons of Satan : the green monster,

Ecce venit nova progenies, JEthere proditus alter homo, Non luteus, velut ille prior, Sed Deus ipse gerens homi-

now sluggish and disabled, coils his huge folds round himself, and on the grass vomits out his venom.

Well may the fierce wolf tremble, and flee from the dear white lambs of the fold ! Sulky and vexed, he prowls around the inclosure wherein they safely browse : he dare not think of blood, nor show his rabid teeth.

O wonderful change ! the lamb commands the lion, and the heavenly Dove in her descent to earth makes the ravenous eagle flutter through the clouds and the winds.

The following Hymn belongs to the 8th century. It was written by the celebrated Paul the Deacon, who, after being secretary to Charlemagne, became a monk at Monte-Cassino. Here, too, we find the clearest profession of faith in the Immaculate Con- ception. The poison of original sin, as the author expresses it, has run its infection through the entire human race ; but the Creator sees that the womb of Mary is pure, and there he enters.

HYMN.

the garden wherein grew the divine plant, the holy foun- tain sealed with the myste- rious gift : she it is that made the world happy by the fruit of her virginal womb.

Our first parent brought death on himself, by drink- ing in the poison of the wicked serpent ; thence came the pestilence on all man- kind, and it was mortal.

But the Creator of the world took compassion on man, and seeing the womb of the Virgin, that was pure from sin, it is by her he decrees to convey the joys of salvation to the world that languished in crime.

Gabriel is sent from heaven bearing to the chaste Virgin the eternal decree : and she becomes Mother of the Word, her womb con- taining within it Him that fills the earth.

A chaste maid, yet a mother ! a virgin, yet a parent ! The Creator of the world was born in his own world; the sceptre was wrested from the hands of the dreaded enemy ; a new light shone throughout the whole world.

To the Trinity, the one only God, be glory, honour, power, highest strength, and kingdom, for ever and for ever. Amen.

ADVENT.

The following Prose was used in many Churches, two hundred years ago, on the Feast of the Immacu- late Conception.

Dies iste celebretur, In quo pie recensetur Conceptio Marise.

Virgo Mater generatur ; Concipitur et creatur Dulcis vena venise.

Adae vetus exsilium, Et Joachim opprobrium, Hinc habent remedium,

Hoc Prophetae prsevide- runt, Patriarchae praesenserunt, Inspirante gratia.

Virga prolem conceptura, Stella solem paritura, Hodie concipitur.

Flos de Virga processurus, Sol de Stella nasciturus, Christus intelligitur.

O quam felix et praeclara, Nobis grata, Deo chara, Fuit haec Conceptio !

Terminatur miseria ; Datur misericordia ; Luctus cedit gauclio.

Nova mater novam prolem, Nova stella novum solem, Nova profert gratia.

Genitorem genitura, Creatorem creatura, Patrem parit filia.

Let this day be kept as a feast, on which is celebrated the Conception of Mary.

The Virgin-Mother is be- gotten ; she, the sweet source of pardon, is conceived on this day.

It was the remedy of those two evils, the long exile of Adam, and the disgrace of Joachim,

It was this that the inspir- ing grace of God made the Prophets foretell, and the Patriarchs foresee.

This day is conceived Jesse's Branch, that was to produce a Flower, the Star that was to bring forth the Sun.

Who is the Flower that was to rise from the Branch, who the Sun that was to be born from the Star, but Christ our Lord 1

O happy and glorious Con- ception ! so welcome to us, and so dear to God !

Misery is at an end ; mercy is given to us ; sadness is succeeded by joy.

By a new, unheard-of grace, a new Mother gives birth to a new offspring, and a new Star produces a new Sun.

She that is made brings forth Him that made her, the creature her Creator, the daughter her Father.

DEC. 8. THE IMMACULATE CONCEPTION. 429

O wonderful novelty ! O novel prerogative ! the Mother's purity is made purer by the conception of her Child!

Be glad, thou gracious Maid, thou Branch so lovely with thy Flower, thou Mother so venerable with thy divine Babe, thou truly full of joy !

That which was heretofore hid under the thick cloud of figures, is now made manifest by the daughter of the holy Anne ; the dew of the Deity enriches this her child, and she, apure Virgin, brings forth Jesus, whilst nature beholds with astonishment an excep- tion made to all her laws.

There was a sound of male- diction in the very name of Eva : but Gabriel's saluta- tion, by an admirable change, formed A ve out of Eva. Vir- gin-Mother ! that didst re- ceive this good and sweet word in thy little cell at Nazareth ; grant us the con- solation of thy favour.

Come, all ye faithful, delay not ; open your lips, and with hearty praise honour the Mother of Jesus ; pray to her ; every day, and every hour, let the mind concord with the voice in prayer and praise : yea, even so must ye beg and implore her patron- age.

Mary ! thou the unfailing hope of the wretched, the true Mother of orphans, the consolation of the afflicted, the health of the sick, thou art all to all.

O mirandam novitatem, Novam quoque dignitatem ! Ditat matris castitatem Filii conceptio.

Gaude, Virgo gratiosa, Virga flore speciosa, Mater prole generosa, Vere plena gaudio.

Quod prsecessit in figura, Nube latens sub obscura, Hoc declarat genitura Pise matris : Virgo pura, Pariendi vertit jura, Fusa, mirante natura, Deitatis pluvia.

Triste f uit in Eva vce ! Sed ex Eva format ave, Versa vice, sed non prave ; Intus ferens in conclave Verbum bonum et suave ; Nobis, Mater Virgo, f ave Tua frui gratia.

Omnis homo, sine mora, Laude plena solvens ora, Istam colas, ipsam ora : Omni die, omni hora, Sit mens supplex,voxsonora Sic supplica, sic implora Hujus patrocinia.

Tu spes certa miserorum, Vere mater orphanorum, Tu levamen oppressorum, Medicamen infirmorum, Omnibus es omnia.

DEC. 9. SECOND DAY WITHIN THE OCTAVE. 431

Decembek 9. THE SECOND DAY WITHIN THE OCTAVE

OF THE IMMACULATE CONCEPTION.

Let us consider how the immaculate Mary came into this world nine months after her Conception, and how each day of her life gave man fresh reason to hope for the great promises made him by God. Let us admire the fulness of grace which God has given to her, and contemplate the respect and the love wherewith the holy Angels look upon her as the future Mother of Him who is to be their Head and King, as well as ours. Let us follow this august Queen to the Temple of Jerusalem, where she is pre- sented by her parents, St. Joachim and St. Anne. When but three years of age, she was initiated into all the secrets of divine love. "I always rose at " midnight (thus she spoke of herself, in a revelation " to St. Elizabeth of Hungary), and went before the " Altar of the Temple, where I besought of God that " I might observe all the commandments of his Law, "and be enriched with those graces which would " render me pleasing to his Majesty. I most " earnestly prayed him, that I might live to see that " most holy virgin who was to bring forth into this "world his own divine Son. I asked him to grant * me to enjoy the use of my eyes that I might see " her, of my tongue that I might praise her, of my " hands that I might serve her, of my feet that I

432 ADVENT.

"might go her errands, and of my knees that I " might adore the Son of God resting in her arms."

Thou, O Mary, thou thyself wast this Virgin, who was worthy of the praises of men and Angels ! But God had not yet revealed it to thee, and thy heavenly humility forbade thy thinking that the immense dignity, which thou didst so deeply venerate, could ever be thine. Nay, thou wast the first and the only one of the daughters of Israel that had re- nounced all hope of ever being the Mother of the Messias. To be Mother of the Messias was, indeed, an ineffable honour ; but it seemed as though it could only be received on the condition of having another Spouse besides God, and this thou wouldst not suffer ; thou wouldst be united to God alone, and thy vow of Virginity which made thee so, was dearer to thee than the possibility of any privilege, which would rob thee even of a tittle of that. Thy marriage with St. Joseph, therefore, was a fresh lustre added to thy incomparable purity, whilst, in the design's of God, it provided thee with the protection which thy coming honours would soon require. We follow thee, O Spouse of Joseph, into thy house at Nazareth, where is to be spent thy humble life. There we behold thee diligent in all thy duties, the valiant Woman of the Scriptures,1 the object of the admiration of God and his Angels. Suffer us, O Mary ! to unite our Advent devotions with the prayers which thou didst offer up for the coming of the Messias ; with the veneration wherewith thou didst think upon Her that was to be his Mother ; and with the inflamed desires wherewith thou didst long for the divine Saviour. We salute thee as the Virgin2 foretold by Isaias ; it is thyself, O blessed Mother, that deservest the praise and love of the holy people and city, the redeemed of the Lo7xl.3

SEQUENCE. {Taken from the Gluny Missal o/1523.)

Let us venerate the Virgin, the Mother of grace, the sweetness of Salvation, the fount of Wisdom.

She is the palace of the King, the Queen of prudence, the Virgin full of grace, the Aurora of joy.

She is sweeter than honey, the lily of chastity ; she is brighter than the jaspar, our solace in sorrow.

O fountain most admirable, source whence came the au- thor of our faith, Mother most admirable, precious vessel of virtue.

Thou art the purest Mother of the beautiful King ; thou art the perfume of precious ointment ; thou art the sweet- est Rose.

Rejoice, 0 glorious tree of life, O brightest of stars, O noblest of Mothers, O Virgin most holy !

Thou the sinner's help, and Queen of counsel, didst bring forth the flower of flowers, Jesus the source of our joy.

Branch of Jesse, light of the Saints, help of the needy, be mindful of us sinners on the day of judgment.

Thou art the joy of the world, the model of charity, the encouragement to victory, the treasury of every fra- grance.

To thee, O sweetest flower, Immaculate Virgin, be queen- ly honour for ever.

Amen.

DEC. 10. THIRD DAY WITHIN THE OCTAVE. 435

December 10. THE THIRD DAY WITHIN THE OCTAVE

OF THE IMMACULATE CONCEPTION.

Let us contemplate our Blessed Lady's being visited by the Angel Gabriel, and conceiving in her chaste womb the Creator of the universe aud the Redeemer of mankind. But that we may the better relish the sweetness of this great Mystery, let us listen to the Seraphic St. Bonaventure, who, in his Meditations on the Life of Christ, has brought these sublime scenes of the Gospel so vividly before us, that one would almost suppose it was an eye-witness was speaking to us. No human language has ever sur- passed the unction and pathos of these Meditations. " Now, when the fulness of that time had come, wherein the Most High Trinity, in exceeding love, had decreed to save mankind by the Incarnation of the Word ; the Divine Mercy, and the instant prayers of the blessed Spirits, pressed for the accomplishment of this redemption. The Blessed Virgin Mary having returned to Nazareth, the Almighty called unto him the Archangel Gabriel, and thus spake unto him : ' Go 1 thou unto our well-beloved Daughter Mary, that is ' espoused unto Joseph, she that is dear unto us ' above all our creatures ; and say unto her, that the ' Son of God hath been taken with her beauty, and ' chosen her that she be his Mother. Pray her that 1 she accept him joyously, for that through her have

436 ADVENT.

' I decreed to save all mankind, and no longer re- ' member the injuries done unto me.'

" Whereupon, Gabriel arose joyous and glad, and flew from on high, and suddenly stood in a human form before the Virgin Mary, who was in the inner chamber of her cot. But not so quick had been his flight, but that he found already there the Holy Trinity, that had gone before their ambassador. As soon, therefore, as the faithful Spirit Gabriel perceived the Virgin Mary, he said : Hail ! full of grace; the Lord is ivith thee : blessed art thou among women. But she was troubled, and answered him not a word. Her trouble came not from a guilty fear, nor from the sight of Gabriel, for oft-times did she receive the visits of the Angels ; but, according to what the Gospel saith, she was troubled at his saying, thinking within herself upon it, for that it was strange unto her to hear Gabriel speak such manner of salutation.

" The humble Virgin was perforce troubled at it, finding therein three praises of herself. She was praised for that she was full of grace; and that the Lord ivas with her; and that she was blessed above all women. He that is humble, cannot hear his own praise without blushes and trouble. Therefore, Mary was troubled with fitting and virtuous shame. She began wondering how this that she heard could be true ; not forasmuch as she suspected the Angel's having said aught that was false, but by reason tha the humble ever ponder their defects and not their virtues, whereby they may always advance ; counting their great virtue to be little, and their little defects great. As one that was prudent and wary, timid and bashful, she answered not. In truth, what could she say ? Do thou learn, from her example, to be silent, and to love to speak little, for exceeding great and useful is this virtue. Twice is she spoke unto, before she speaks once, for it is a thing intolerable that a virgin should be a great talker.

DEC. 10. THIRD DAY WITHIN THE OCTAVE. 437

" As soon, therefore, as the Angel saw that she was inus in doubt, he said : - Fear not, Mary, neither blush ' thou at the praises I have spoken unto thee, for they ' are most true. Thou thyself art full of grace ; nay, ' verily, I tell thee, that thou hast found for man the ' grace he had lost. For behold ! thou shalt conceive ' and bring forth a Son, that hath chosen thee for his ' Mother, and he shall save all that put their trust in ' him.' Whereupon she made answer, heeding nothing the praises of the Angel, but seeking how it could be that that should not be taken from her, which was pre- cious unto her above measure ; and she asked of the Angel, saying : 'How shall this be? for I have vowed

* my Virginity for ever unto God, that I never should 1 know man.' The Angel answered, and said : - It ' shall be done by the operation of the Holy Ghost, 1 who shall fill thee as no tongue can speak. Thou ' shalfc conceive by his power, yet shalt remain a pure

* Virgin, and therefore shall thy son be called the Son ' of God. For unto God nothing is impossible. For ' thy cousin Elizabeth, that is old and called barren,

* has conceived a son by the power of God, now these ' six months past/

" Consider here, I beseech thee, for God's sake, how the Trinity is there, waiting the answer and consent of this their, most beloved daughter, and taking de- light in her modesty, and ways, and words ; and also, how diligent and wise is the Angel in his endeavour to obtain her consent, and how admirable are his words, and how he stands with his head bowed down before his and our Lady, with a placid and recollected look, doing his embassy with exactitude, and atten- tively noting Mary's words, so as to be able to satisfy her in his answers, and execute the divine will in this wondrous work. See, too, how our Lady stands in holy fear and humility, showing in her face the blush of modesty, and surprise at thie so sudden visit of the Angel. Neither have his words extolled her in her

438 ADVENT.

own esteem : and albeit they were such as never had been spoken to mortal, yet does she attribute nought to herself, but all to grace. Learn, therefore, of her to have modesty and humility, for without them even virginity availeth little. The most prudent Virgin is full of joy, and gives consent unto the words of the Angel. Then, as is related in the revelations made to a devout servant of God, throwing herself on her knees with intense devotion, and joining her hands together, she said unto the Angel : ' Behold the hand- ' maid of the Lord, be it done unto me according to ' thy word.' Then straightways did the Son of God enter the Virgin's womb, and took unto himself flesh of her substance, and though his whole Person was there, yet did he not cease to abide still wholly in the bosom of his Father.

" Then did Gabriel also kneel down, and shortly after rise up together with our Lady. He once more, bowed down even unto the ground, and wishing her farewell, he disappeared : and going back to heaven, he related all these things, and a new joy was there, and a new feast, and exceeding great jubilee. But our Lady, all devout, and burning with a love of God such as she had felt not before, for she perceived what was done within her, knelt to give thanks for this so great gift, humbly and devoutly supplicating the divine Majesty that he would vouchsafe to teach her how she should comport herself with all perfec- tion in her treatment of this his Only Begotten Son."

Such is the description of the mystery of the An- nunciation given us by the Seraphic Doctor. Let us profoundly adore our Creator, who has thus humbled himself out of love for us, and from the desire he has to succour us in our misery. Let us also salute Mary, the Mother of God and of men.

PROSE.

(Taken from the Cluny Missal of 1523.)

This is a day of joy ! let us celebrate it in honour of the Blessed Virgin Mary, who gave us him that cleansed us from sin.

He that is the source of true light, brought up this Branch from the root of Jesse ; and his wisdom has made her the temple of his grace.

It is a new rising of a new Star, at which our death dies : it is now that what was lost by the fall of Eve, is found again in Mary.

This is the Holy Virgin that is described as the Aurora rising, as the lovely moon, as the sun, the brightest of orbs.

O Virgin Mother, Virgin of Virgins, fragrant cloud of smoke, sun shedding the

Eerfume of its light ! in thee oth heaven and earth de- light.

In the fulness of time, the Word of the Father entered into thy chaste womb ; wholly in thee, and wholly in the bosom of his Father.

Jesus, the beautiful fruit of a virgin tree, snatched us, in his giant strength, from the claims which sin and hell had upon us.

This God, that saved the human race, is the Son of

He that might have punished us for the sin of our first parents, became himself the Mediator be- tween God and man.

In thy chaste womb, O Mary ! was made that merci- ful barter, whereby salvation was given to the sinner.

Truly, then, thou art the cause of our joy and hope ! Oh ! pray, that after running the race of this present life, we may receive the looked- for prize in heaven. Amen.

DEC. 10. ST. MELCHIADES. 441

THE SAME DAY.

SAJNT MELCHIADES, POPE AND MARTYR

The Church makes a Commemoration, on this same day within the Octave, of the holy Pope Melchiades. This illustrious Pontiff, whom St. Augustine calls the true child of the peace of Jesus Christ, the worthy Father of the Christian people, ascended the papal throne in the year 311, that is, during the very fiercest storm of persecution. It is on this account that he is honoured with the title of Martyr. Though he did not shed his blood for the name of Jesus, yet he shared in the glory of the Martyrs, by reason of the great trials he had to suffer during the persecution, which afflicted the entire Church. It was the same with many of his predecessors. But the Pontificate of Melchiades marks a very im- portant period of the Church, — the transition from persecution to peace. As early as the year 312, liberty had been granted to the Christian religion by Constantine.

DEC. 10. TRANSLATION OF THE HOUSE OF LORETTO. 443

THE SAME DAY.

THE TRANSLATION

OF THE HOLY HOUSE OF LORETTO.

This feast is not one of those which is inserted in the universal calendar of the Church ; but it is kept at Rome and in the Papal States, in Tuscany, in the Kingdom of Naples, in Spain, in Belgium, in a great many dioceses in all parts of the Christian world, and by almost all the Religious Orders. It was instituted in thanksgiving for the great favour bestowed on the Western Church, whereby God, to console Christians for the loss of the Holy Sepulchre, miraculously translated into a Catholic land the humble yet ever venerable House, in which Mary received the message of the Angel, and where, by the consent of this Holy Virgin, the Word was made flesh and began to dwell among us. It is no unusual thing to meet with Catholics, who are sin- cerely devoted to their holy faith, yet who have never heard of the House of Loretto. It is for their sakes that we have resolved to take the opportunity of this Feast to give an exact and concise account of this wonderful event. We take it from the learned and judicious author of the Life of Olier.

" It was during the Pontificate of Celestine V., in 1291, when the Christians had irrevocably lost the Holy places of Palestine, that the House, wherein was achieved the mystery of the Incarnation in the

444 ADVENT.

womb of Mary, was translated by the Angels from Nazareth into Dalmatia or Sclavonia, and placed by them on a hill near a little town called Tersatto. The miracles which were continually being wrought in this holy house, the official enquiry made by chosen deputies who visited Nazareth in order to attest the Translation, and, lastly, the universal belief of all countries and the pilgrims who went from all parts to venerate a Sanctuary which had ever been dear to Christians, — all this seemed proof enough of the miracle. But God gave another testimony, of which the whole people of Italy and Dalmatia were the vouchers.

" Three years and seven months had elapsed since this first translation, when, in the year 1294, the Holy House was carried across the Adriatic Sea to the territory of Recanati, and placed in a forest the property of a lady called Loretta. The inhabitants of Dalmatia were in the deepest affliction : nothing could have been a greater trial to them. As a slight consolation to themselves, they erected a church on the spot where the house had stood ; it was dedi- cated to our Lady, and was served, later on, by the Franciscan Fathers. Over the porch was placed this inscription : This is the place where stood the Holy House of Nazareth, which now is honoured in the territory of Recanati.1 Many of the people of Dal- matia went to live in Italy near the Holy House, where they instituted the Society of Corpus Domini (known under the name of Sclavonians), which lasted even to the Pontificate of Paul III.

" This second Translation was soon rumoured throughout Christendom. There came from almost every part of Europe innumerable pilgrims to Reca- nati, that they might visit the House, which has ever

1 Hie est locus in quo fuit sacra Domus Nazareua, quae nunc in Recineti partibus colitur.

DEC. 10. TEANSLATION OF THE HOUSE OF LOEETTO. 445

since gone under the name of The House of Loretto. The people of Recanati, anxious that ever}^ doubt upon this favour granted them should be removed, sent over, first to Dalmatia and afterwards to Naza- reth, sixteen of the most respectable persons of the neighbourhood, who were instructed to make fresh enquiries in both places. But here again, God would certify the prodigy by a third and a fourth Transla- tion, which were made, close upon each other, in the same territory of Recanati, The Holy House had not been in the Forest of Loretto eight months, when it was found that the pilgrims were continually attacked by brigands, who were attracted to the neighbourhood by the hope of booty. The house was miraculously removed the distance of a mile, and placed on a piece of rising ground, which belonged to two brothers of the family of the Antici. These also laid hands on the offerings of the pilgrims ; and having quarrelled about the division of their plunder, they took up arms against each other. Then it was that the Holy House, in the year 1295, was once more translated : this time also to a very short distance, but near the high road. There has been built the town of Loretto, and there, to this day, remains the House of Loretto ."

This prodigy has been attested not only by the annalists of the Church, and by the local historians of Loretto (e.g., Tursellini and Martorelli), but by writers whose profound learning has gained them a world-wide reputation, and among them we may cite Papebroke, Natalis Alexander, Benedict XIV., Trombelli, &c. Who, that is not blind with prejudice, could seriously think of preferring an idle repugnance to the authority of such writers as these, who are the received masters of historical criticism, and whose united opinion would not be rejected on any other question ?

But, in a Catholic point of view, it is certain that

446 ADVENT.

those persons would be guilty of excessive temerity, who would disregard the countless miracles which have been wrought in the Holy House of Loretto. They dare not deny all these miracles ; and yet, by denying the fact in question, they are admitting that God is giving his sanction by miracles to what would be, if false, the most absurd and grossest deception. They would incur the imputation of temerity on another ground, inasmuch as they would be slight- ing the authority of the Holy See, which has been, for upwards of five hundred years, so zealous in de- fending the truth of this Translation, and in offering it to the veneration of the faithful as a means of honouring the Incarnate Word and his ever Blessed Mother. Among the explicit approbations of the Holy See regarding the miracle of Loretto, we will mention the Bulls of Paul II., of Leo X., of Paul III., of Paul IV., and of Xystus Y. ; the Decree of Urban VIII., in 1632, establishing this Feast in the Marche of Ancona; the Decree of Innocent XII., in 1699, approving the Proper Office of the Feast ; and finally, the Indults of Benedict XIII., and his successors, extending this feast to the several provinces of the Catholic world.

That we may enter into the spirit of the Holy See, which has spared nothing in order to encourage the confidence of the faithful in the Holy House of Na- zareth, or rather (as by the divine mercy it has now become) the House of Loretto, we will give the follow- ing from the Office of its miraculous Translation :

ANTIPHON.

Ecce tabernaculum Dei Behold the tabernacle of cum hominibus, et habitavit God with men, wherein he cum eis ; et ipsi populus ejus dwelt with them ; and they erunt, et ipse Deus cum eis shall be his people, and God erit eorum Deus. himself with them shall be

Through the same Jesus Christ our Lord. Amen.

SAINT EULALIA, VIRGIN AND MARTYR.

The Church of Spain, the fair pearl of Christendom, brings before us on this same tenth of December her illustrious Martyr Eulalia, the glory of Merida, the ornament of Iberia, the joy of the universal Church. She is the third of those Wise Virgins, whose names are most prominent in the Church's liturgy during the season of Advent. She is the worthy companion of Bibiana, and Barbara, and that heroic Lucy whose feast we shall keep on the thirteenth. We give the whole of the beautiful poem on the life and martyr- dom of Eulalia, written by Prudentius. Never, perhaps, did this prince of Christian poets write finer verses than these ; nor can we be surprised that the Mozarabic Liturgy, in its admiration of this exquisite canticle, should have made but one Hymu of its forty-five stanzas. As it gives the Life of oui Saint, we shall not add the Legend of the Proper Office as used in the Churches of Spain.

splendid heroine : it is a

Eowerful and populous city, ut its proudest title to fame is that there the Saint shed her blood, and there rests her shrine.

But thrice four winters had passed over Eulalia, when she braved the fierce tortures of fire, and made her execu- tioners tremble by her cou- rage, suffering as though it were sweet to suffer.

Already had she proved to men that she would have no Spouse but God, and that earthly nuptials were too poor for her. Though but a girl, she despised the toys and sports of children.

Perfumes and wreaths of roses, and golden trinkets, all were beneath her. Her look demure, her gait modest, her whole conduct, even at that tender age, as though the gravity of old age were upon it.

But when a rabid persecu- tion began to threaten the servants of God, and the Christians were commanded to burn incense and the flesh of victims before the dead gods of the pagans,

Oh! then did Eulalia's soul chafe within her, and her high spirit thirst for the battle ! She, a girl, defies the threats of men that talk of war, for her heart pants after God.

But her fond mother trem- bles for her courageous child, and insists on her keeping at home. She takes her into the country, as far as may be from the city, lest the daunt-

less child, that longed to die for Christ, should seek to purchase that glory at the price of her blood.

She ill brooks this quiet, this shelter which seems to her so unchristian : the night comes on ; she is alone ; she forces open the doors, and escaping from her inclosure, she tends she knows not whither.

The paths are rugged, and thorns prick her feet at every step ; yet on she goes, with Angels in her company. All is silent in the dark grim night ; but she has light which leads her.

As our fathers, that brave Hebrew band, had of old a pillar of light, which piercing the murky gloom of night, led them on by its bright blaze, and turned darkness into day ;

So this holy maid ; in her midnight journey, God gave her light ; and as she fled from the land of Egypt, to enter into that of heaven, she was not hindered by the darkness.

Many a mile had she walked with her hasty step, before the day-dawn broke upon the world : and scarce had morn begun, when there stood be- fore the tribunal, amidst the ensigns of the empire, the fearless Virgin.

"What madness is this," she cried, " which makes you " lose your unthinking souls 1 " wasting away your love in " adoring these chiselled " lumps of stone, whilst you " deny God the Father of all]

"O wretched men ! you " are in search, of the Ohris- " tians : lo ! I am one ; I " hate your worship of devils : "I trample on your idols; " and with heart and mouth " I acknowledge but one God.

"Isis, Apollo, Venus, all " are nothing ; Maximian, " too, is nothing ; they, be- " cause they are idols ; he, " because he worships idols ; "both are vain, both are " nothing.

" Maximian calls himself " lord, and yet he makes him- " self a slave of stones, ready "to give his very head to " such gods. And why does " he persecute them that have " nobler hearts 1

" This good Emperor, this " most upright Judge, feeds " on the blood of the inno- " cent. He gluts himself on " the bodies of the saints, " embowelling those temples " of purity, and cruelly in- " suiting their holy faith.

" Do thy worst, thou cruel " butcher ; burn, cut, tear " asunder these clay-made " bodies. It is no hard thing " to break a fragile vase like "this. But all thy tortures " cannot reach the soul."

At these words the Praetor, maddening with rage, cried out : " Away, Lictor, with " this senseless prattler, and "punish her in every way "thou canst. Teach her that " our country's gods are gods, " and that our sovereign's " words are not to be slighted.

The Martyr answered him not : but full of indignation, spat in the tyrant's face ; then, with her foot, upsets idols, cakes, and incense.

Scarce had she done it, two executioners seize her : they tear her youthful breast, and, one on each side, cut off her innocent flesh even to the very ribs. Eulalia counts each gash, and says :

" See, dear Jesus, they " write thee on my flesh ! " Beautiful letters, that tell " of thy victory ! O, how I " love to read them ! So, " this red stream of my blood " speaks thy holy name P

Thus sang the joyous and intrepid virgin ; not a tear, not a moan. The sharp tor- tures reach not her souL Her body is all stained with the fresh blood, and the warm stream trickles down the snow-white skin.

But this was not the end. It was not enough to plough and harrow up her flesh : it was time to burn : torches, then, are applied to her sides and breast.

Her beateous locks dish- evelled fell veiling her from worse than all their butchery, the stare of these wretches.

The crackling flame mounts to her face, and, running through her hair, surrounds and blazes over her head. The virgin, thirstingfor death, opens her mouth and drinks it in.

Suddenly is seen a snow- white dove coming from the martyr's mouth, and flying up

Her soul is fled : her head droops, the fire dies out : her lifeless body sleeps in peace, while her glad spirit keeps feast in its ethereal home, and this sweet dove rests in the house of her most High God.

The executioners, too, see the dove issuing from the martyr's mouth : astonished and trembling they flee from the spot. The lictor, too, is seized with fear and takes to flight.

JTis winter, and the snow in thick flakes falls on the forum, covering the tender corpse of Eulalia, which lay stiffening in the cold, with its fair pall of crystal.

Ye men that mourn at fu- nerals, weeping and sobbing out your love for the dead, ye are not needed here : give place. God bids his elements, O Eulalia, do the honours of thy exequies.

Her tomb is now at Me- rida, illustrious city of Vet- tonia, whose beautiful walls are washed by the swift green waters of Ana, that cele- brated stream.

'Tis there, in a temple rich with its polished marbles, both of Spain and foreign lands, that repose in a vener- able tomb the holy relics of the martyr.

by them that can well wield the sword, but by them that can be chaste ; not by the combatant's title, but by his motive. An innocent con- science fears not an armed legion. He that has van- quished sin, will not flinch at a sword. He that has con- quered himself, easily con- quers others : and if it be praiseworthy when a man does a virtuous act, it is more so when a virgin does a manly deed. The holy virgin Eu- lalia stands before a tribunal of ungodly men; and with God alone in her heart, she bids defiance to all their tor- tures. There comes a Lictor as lustful as he is cruel : he punishes this spouse of Christ as we may indeed call her, by the torture of his impure looks ; and she that could have no adultery to atone for, suffered its punishment from him that had. He reserves to the last what he knew was the worst ; he exposes her body to the gaze of the spec- tators, and the stream of blood from the open gashes on her sides stains her flesh before the knife can open deeper wounds. Then was con- founded the design of the wicked tormentor, and his torments are insulted by the victim. Impiety strips our Martyr, but modesty veils her. Let all, then, learn from this virgin to cultivate not beauty but virtue, nor form but faith. He that would please the Lord must be tried

And yet, O Jesus ! since it was from thee that Eulalia had all her merits, and from thee all that she achieved, (for it is in vain that we would repel the darts of our enemies, un- less we be shielded by thy divine mercy) ; grant, we be- seech thee, that, as this thy most holy martyr won, by her combat, the reward of chastity, we also may be for- given the uncleanness of our sins, and obtain the rewards thou hast promised.

It is meet and just that we give thee thanks, O Lord, our God ! who hast raised to the highest glory this most wise virgin that was loyal to the faith. Thus didst thou, that madest Mary be the Mother of Jesus, make Eulalia be a Martyr of Jesus. The Mother was happy in giving him birth ; the Martyr in giving him her life. The Mother ministered to his Incarna- tion ; the Martyr imitated his Passion. Mary believed the Angel that appeared to her ; Eulalia withstood the enemy that tormented her. Mary was chosen by whom Christ should be born ; Eu- lalia was elected by whom the devil should be con- quered. Eulalia, the Martyr and Virgin, was indeed wor- thy to please her Lord, for, by the protection of the Holy

Ghost, she, a young maiden, waged a fierce war ; she, that with more than human strength, made herself, for thy love, a victim of suffering; she, that for the sake of thy beloved Son, shed her blood in the noble confession of her faith, and offered to him, as a fragrance of sweetest incense, the flesh which fire could not consume. She goes unbidden to the tribunal of the cruel persecutor. As fit as was the place for a triumph, so bold was her spirit to speak the secret of her faith. She wants a king- dom, she cares not for tor- tures, she would find Him she longs for, she . would see Him that she confesses. Fearless of pain, certain of a crown, happy on her rack, hopeful of her prize. She is questioned, she confesses ; men put her to death, God gives her the crown. By an ad- mirable miracle, the Virgin's spirit, which thy divine Ma- jesty didst draw from its prison by a flame, thou didst take to thyself as a Dove ; thus, under the same symbol whereby thou didst show thy Son to the earth, did thy Martyr ascend into heaven. Neither did the elements withhold their homage ; but over her body, which remain- ed on the earth, they form a snowy canopy, that beauti- fies, and covers, and hides that body where there had ever been the inflexibility of virtue and the unsullied lily

And we too, O glorious Martyr, would join our humble praises with these sublime expressions of the Church's love for thee. The love of Jesus so filled thy heroic soul, that torments could not torture thee; nay, they satisfied thy love by giving thee to suffer for him, until thy whole heart should be filled by possessing him. And yet, with all this ardour which heeds no obstacle, with all this noble daring which makes thee confront a tyrant and a furious rabble, nothing is more gentle and meek than thy loving spirit. Pray for us to Him who made thee thus worthy to be his Spouse, that we also may be coura- geous in the fight against the enemies of our salvation, and full of that tender love for Jesus which can alone preserve us from hardness and pride of heart.

O thou, the glory of Iberia ! O Dove of Peace, have pity on that Catholic land which prepared thee for heaven. Suffer not that the ancient faith grow dim in a country which, for ages, stood so prominent in the Catholic Church, as the faithful and fervent Spain. Pray for her, that the days of her trial may be shortened; that God may bring to nought the sacrilegious attempts of men, who have sworn to destroy his kingdom on earth ; that he give to the clergy of Spain the courage and energy of former days ; that he render fruitful the blood of her martyrs, who have already suffered ; that he take away those scandals, which so readily mislead the simple and the weak ; and lastly, that he efface not thy beloved Spain from the number of Catholic

RESPONSORY OF ADVENT.

(Ambrosian Breviary, Fourth Sunday of Advent.)

1$. Per Gabrielis Angeli os, nunciatum est Virgini Marise, et Verbum concepit e ccelo : * Et ilium suseepit modicus uterus, cui parvus fuerat mundus. ft. Spiritus Sanctus in te ingredietur, et virtus Altissimi obumbra- bit tibi : * Et ilium suseepit modicus uterus, cui parvus fuerat mundus.

3^. A message was an- nounced to the Virgin Mary by the mouth of the Angel Gabriel ; and she conceived the Word from heaven : * And the womb of a tender Virgin contained Him, whom the world was too little to contain, ft. The Holy Ghost shall enter within thee, and the power of the Most High shall overshadow thee : * And the womb of a tender Virgin contained Him, whom the world was too little to contain.

December 11. SAINT DAMASUS, POPE AND CONFESSOR

This great Pontiff comes before us in the Liturgical Year, not to bring us tidings of Peace, as St. Mel- chiades did, but as one of the most illustrious de- fenders of the great Mystery of the Incarnation. He defends the faith of the Universal Church in the divinity of the Word, by condemning, as his pre- decessor Liberius had done, the acts and the authors of the celebrated Council of Rimini. With his sovereign authority, he bears witness to the teaching of the Church regarding the Humanity of Jesus Christ, and condemned the heretic Apollinaris, who taught that Jesus Christ had only assumed the flesh and not the soul of man. He commissioned St. Jerome to make a new translation of the New Tes- tament from the Greek, for the use of the Church of Rome ; here, again, giving a further proof of the faith and love which he bore to the Incarnate Word. Let us honour this great Pontiff, whom the Council of Chalcedon calls the ornament and support of Home by his piety. St. Jerome, too, who looked upon St. Damasus as his friend and patron, calls him a man of the greatest worth ; a man whose equal could not be found, vjell versed in the holy Scrip- tures, and a virgin Doctor of the virgin Church. The Legend of the Breviary gives us a brief account of his life.

Basilicas duas sediflcavit ; alteram sancti Laurentii no- mine ad theatrum Pompeii, quam maximis muneribus auxit, eique domos, et prse- dia attribuit : alteram via Ardeatina ad Catacumbas. Platoniam etiam, ubi cor- pora sanctorum Petri et Pauli aliquandiu jacuerunt, dedicavit, et exornavit ele- gantibus versibus. Idemque prosa, et versn scripsit de Virginitate, multaque alia metro edidit.

Pcenam talionis constitnit iis, qui alteram falsi criminis accusassent. Statuit, ut quod pluribus jam locis erat in usu, Psalmi per omnes Ecclesias die noctuque ab alternis canerentur ; et in fine cujusque Psalmi dicere- tur Gloria Patri, et Filio, et Spiritui Sancto. Ejus jussu

He called the first Council of Constantinople, in which he condemned the impious heresy of Eunomius and Macedonius. He also con- demned the Council of Ri- mini, which had already been rejected by Liberius, inasmuch as it was in this assembly of Rimini, as St. Jerome tells us, that mainly by the craft of Valens and Ursascius, was published a condemnation of the faith which had been taught by the Nicene Council, and thus the whole world grieved to find itself made Arian.

He built two Basilicas ; one dedicated to St. Lau- rence, near Pompey's theatre, and this he endowed with magnificent presents, with houses and with lands : the other, on the Ardeatine Way, at the Catacombs. The bodies of SS. Peter and Paul lay for some time in a place richly adorned with marbles ; this place he de- dicated, and composed for it several inscriptions in beau- tiful verses. He also wrote on Virginity, both in prose and verse, and several other poems.

He established the law of retaliation for cases of false accusation. He decreed that, as was the custom in many places, the Psalms should be sung in all churches in alter- nate choirs, day and night ; and that at the end of each Psalm, there should be added : Glory be to tlie

Father, and to the Son, and to the Holy Ghost. It was by his order that St. Jerome translated the New Testa- ment from the Greek text. He governed the Church seventeen years, two months, and twenty days ; and five times during this period, he gave Ordinations, in the month of December, to thirty-one Priests, eleven Deacons, and sixty-two Bishops, for divers places. Conspicuous for his virtue, learning, and prudence, and having Jived little short of eighty years, he slept in the Lord, during the reign of Theodosius the Great. He was buried in the Basilica which he had built on the Ardeatine Way, where also lay his mother and sister. His relics were afterwards translated to the Church of Saint Laurence, called after him, St. Laurence's in Da- maso.

sanctus Hieronimus novum Testamentum Graecse fidei reddidit. Quum Ecclesiam rexisset annos decern et septem, menses duos, dies viginti, et habuisset Ordina- tiones quinque mense De- cembri, quibus creavit Pres- byteros triginta unum, Dia- conos undecim, Episcopos per diversa lex sexaginta duos ; virtute, doctrina, ac prudentia clarus, prope octo- genarius, Theodosio seniore imperante, obdormivit in Domino, et via Ardeatina una cum matre et sorore sepultus est in Basilica, quam ipse sedificaverat.

Holy Pontiff Damasus ! during thy life on earth, thou wast the Light, which guided the children of the Church ; for thou didst teach them the mystery of the Incarnation, and didst guard them against those perfidious doctrines, wherewith hell ever strives to corrupt that glorious Symbol of our faith, which tells us of God's infinite mercy towards us, and of the sublime dignity of man thus mercifully redeemed. Seated on the Chair of Peter, thou didst confirm thy brethren, and thy faith failed not ; for Jesus had prayed to his Father for thee. We rejoice at the infinite recompense with which this divine Prince of Pastors has rewarded the unsullied purity of thy

faith, 0 thou virgin Doctor of the virgin Church ! O that we could have a ray of that light which now enables thee to see Jesus in his glory ! Pray for us, that we may have light to see him, and know him, and love him under the humble guise in which he is so soon to appear to us. Obtain for us the science of the sacred Scriptures, in which thou wast so great a Master; and docility to the teachings of the Bishop of Rome, to whom, in the person of St. Peter, Christ has said : Launch out into the deep I1

Obtain also for all Christians, 0 thou the successor of this Prince of the Apostles, that they be animated with those sentiments, which St. Jerome thus de- scribes in one of his letters addressed to thee : " It is " the Chair of Peter that I will consult, for from it do " I derive that faith, which is the food of my soul. I " will search for this precious pearl, heeding not the " vast expanse of sea and land which I must pass " over. Where the body is, there shall the eagles be " gathered together. It is now in the West that the " Sun of justice rises. I ask the Victim of salvation " from the Priest, and from the Shepherd the pro- " tection of the sheep. On that rock I know the " Church is built. He that eats the Lamb in any " house but this, is profane. He that is not in " Noah's Ark, shall perish in the waters of the deluge. " I know not Yitalis, I reject Meletius, I pass by " Paulinus. He that gathers not with thee, Damasus, " scatters ; for he that is not of Christ, is of Anti- " Christ."

Let us contemplate our divine Saviour in the womb of his most holy Mother Mary. Let us, to- gether with the holy Angels, adore him in this state of profound humiliation, to which his love for us has

DEC. 11. ST. DAMASUS. 465

brought him. See him there offering himself to his Father for the redemption of mankind, and com- mencing at once to fulfil the office of our Mediator, which he has taken upon himself. What an excess of love is this of our Jesus, that he is not satisfied with having humbled himself in assuming our nature, and which alone would have sufficed to redeem a million worlds ! The eternal Son of God wills to remain, as other children, nine months in his Mother's womb : after that, to be born in poverty, to live a life of labour and suffering, and to be obedient to death even to the death of the Cross. O Jesus ! mayest thou be praised and loved by all creatures for this thy immense love of us ! Thou hast come down from heaven the Victim that art to take the place of all those which were hitherto offered, but which could not efface man's sin. At length, the earth possesses its Saviour, though as yet unseen. No, God will not curse the earth, which, though covered with crime, i is rich in such a treasure as this. Still repose, O Jesus, in the chaste womb of Mary, that living Ark which contains the true Manna sent for the food of man. But the time is approaching for thee to leave this loved sanctuary. The tender love which thou hast received from Mary, must be changed for the malice wherewith men will treat thee ; yet it must needs be that thou be born on the day which thou thyself hast decreed : it is the will of thy eternal Father, it is the expectation of the world, it is the salvation of all who shall love thee.

468 ADVENT.

December 12. THE FIFTH DAY WITHIN THE OCTAVE

OF THE IMMACULATE CONCEPTION.

Let us contemplate the sentiments of profound re- spect and maternal tenderness, which fill the soul of our Blessed Lady, now that she has conceived Jesus in her chaste womb : he is her God, and yet he is her Son. Let us think upon this wonderful dignity be- stowed upon a creature ; and let us honour the Mother of our God. It was by this mystery that was fulfilled the prophecy of Isaias : Behold, a Virgin shall con- ceive and bear a Son y1 and that of Jeremias : The Lord hath created a neiv thing upon the earth ; a Woman shall compass a Man.2 The Gentiles them- selves had received the tradition of these prophecies. Thus, in the old Pagan Carnutum (Chartres), there was an altar dedicated " To the Virgin that was to " bring forth a Son " (Virgini Pariturw); and whilst modern rationalism, with its ignorant scepticism, was affecting to throw a doubt on this fact of history, the researches of science were discovering that Carnutum was far from being the only city of the West, which had such an altar.

But what human language could express the dignity of our Lady, that carries within her chaste womb Him that is the World's Salvation ! If Moses, after a mere colloquy with God, returned to the

1 Is. vii. 14. s Jer. xxxi. 22.

DEC. 12. FIFTH DAY WITHIN THE OCTAVE. 469

Israelites with the rays of the majesty of Jehovah encircling his head ; — what an aureola of glory was due to Mary, who has within her, as in a living heaven, that very God himself ! The Divine Wisdom tempers the effulgence of her glory that it be not visible to men ; and this in order that the state of humility, which the Son of God has chosen as the one in which he would manifest himself to the world, should not be removed at the very onset by the dazzling glory which would, otherwise, have been seen gleaming from his Mother.

The sentiments which filled the Heart of Mary during these months of her ineffable union with the Divine Word, may be thus expressed in the words of the Spouse in the sacred Canticle : / sat under the shadow of him whom I desired ; and his fruit ivas sweet to my palate. I sleep, but my heart watches. My soul melted ivhen he spoke. I to my Beloved and my Beloved to me, who feedeth among the Lilies, till the day break, and the shadows retire.1 And if there ever were a human heart, that was forced, by the overpowering vehemence of its love of God, to use these other words of the same Canticle, it was Mary's : 0 daughters of Jerusalem ! stay me up with flowers, compass me about with fragrant fruits ; for I languish with love.2 " These sweet " words," says the venerable Peter of Celles, "are those " of the Spouse that dwelleth in the gardens, and is " now near the time of her delivery. What so lovely " in creation as this Virgin, who loves the Lord with " such matchless love and is so exceedingly loved by " this her Lord ? It is She of whom the Scrip- " ture speaks, when it calls the Spouse, the dearest " hind. What, too, so lovely as that well-beloved " Son of God, born of his beloved Father from all " eternity, and now, at the end of time, as the Apostle

1 Cant. ii. 3, 16, 17; v. 2, 6. ... 2 Ibid. ii. 5.

470 ADVENT.

"speaks, formed in the womb of his dearest Mother, " and become to her, in the words of the same divine " proverb, the sweetest fawn ? Let us, therefore, cull " our flowers, and offer them to both Child and " Mother. But let me briefly tell you what are the " flowers you must offer to our Lady. Christ says, " speaking of his humanity, / am the flower of the "field, and the lily of the valleys. By him, there- " fore, let us purify our souls and bodies, and so be " able to approach our God in chastity. Next, pre- " serve this flower of purity from all that would in- "jure it, for flowers are tender things, and soon droop " and fade. Let us wash our hands among the inno- " cent, and, with a pure heart, and pure body, and " cleansed lips, and chaste soul, let us gather, in the " paradise of our heavenly Father, our fresh flowTers " for the new Nativity of our New King. With these "flowers let us stay up this most saintly Mother, " this Virgin of Virgins, this Queen of Queens, this " Lady of Ladies ; that so we may deserve to receive " the blessing of the Mother and the Divine Babe."1

DEC. 13. ST. LUCY. 473

December 13. SAINT LUCY, VIRGIN AND MARTYR

There comes to us, to-day, the fourth of our Wise Virgins, the valiant Martyr, Lucy. Her glorious name shines on the sacred Dyptich of the Canon of the Mass, together with those of Agatha, Agnes, and Cecily; and as often as we hear it pronounced during these days of Advent, it reminds us (for Lucy signi- fies Light), that He who consoles the Church, by enlightening her children, is soon to be with us. Lucy is one of the three glories of the Church of Sicily; as Catania is immortalised by Agatha, and Palermo by Rosaly, so is Syracuse by Lucy. There- fore, let us devoutly keep her feast .: she will aid us by her prayers during> this holy season, and will repay our love by obtainiug for us a warmer love of that Jesus, whose grace enabled her to conquer the world. Once more let us consider, why our Lord has not only given us Apostles, Martyrs, and Bishops as guides to us on our road to Bethlehem, but has willed also that we should be accompanied thither by such Virgins as Lucy. The children of the Church are forcibly reminded by this, that, in approaching the Crib of their Sovereign Lord and God, they must bring with them, besides their faith, that purity of mind and body without which no one can come near to God. Let us now read the glorious Acts of the Virgin Lucy.

Quae ad ejus sepulchrum quurn suppliciter orasset, Agathae intercessione, matris sanita- tem impetravit. Statini vero matre m exoravit, ut quam dotem sibi datura esset, Christi pauperibus tribui pateretur. Ut igitur Syracu- sas rediit, omnem pecuniam, quam ex facultatibus vendi- tis redegerat, pauperibus dis- tribuit.

Quod ubi rescivisset is, cui earn parentes contra Vir- giiiis voluntatem desponde- rant, apud Paschasiurn Prse- fectum, Luciam, quod Chris- tiana esset, accusavit. Quam ille cum nee precibus, nee minis ad cultum idolorum posset perducere ; immo tanto magis incensam videret ad celebrandas christianse fidei laudes, quanto magis ipse earn a sententia avertere conabatur : Cessabunt, in- quit, verba, quum ventum erit ab verbera. Cui Virgo : Dei servis verba deesse non possunt, quibus a Christo Domino dictum est : Quum steteritis ante reges et presi- des, nolite cogitare quomodo aut quid loquamini ; dabitur enim vobis in ilia hora quid loquamini ; non enim vos es- tis qui loquimini, sed Spiritus Sanctus qui loquitur in vobis.

the Christian faith, which she had professed from her infancy, went to Catania, with her mother Eutychia, who was suffering from a flax of blood, there to vene- rate the body of the blessed Agatha. Having prayed fer- vently at the tomb, she ob- tained her mother s cure, by the intercession of Agatha. Lucy then asked her mother that she would permit her to bestow upon the poor of Christ the fortune which she intended to leave her. No sooner, therefore, had she re- turned to Syracuse, than she sold all that was given to her, and distributed the money amongst the poor.

When he to whom her parents had, against her will, promised her in marriage, came to know what Lucy had done, he went before the Prefect Paschasius, and ac- cused her of being a Chris- tian. Paschasius entreated and threatened, but could not induce her to worship the idols ; nay, the more he strove to shake her faith, the more inflamed were the praises which she uttered in profess- ing its excellence. He said, therefore, to her : We shall have no more of thy words, when thou feelest the blows of my executioners. To this the Virgin replied : Words can never be wanting to God's servants, for Christ our Lord has said to them : When you shall be brought before kings and governors, take no thought how or what

Paschasius then asked her : Is the Holy Spirit in thee 1 She answered : They who live chastely and piously, are the temple of the Holy Spirit. He said : I will order thee to be taken to a brothel, that this Holy Spirit may leave thee. The Virgin said to him : The violence wherewith thou threatenest me would obtain for me a double crown of chastity. Whereupon Pas- chasius being exceeding an- gry, ordered Lucy to be drag- ged to a place where her treasure might be violated ; but, by the power of God, so firmly was she fixed to the place where she stood, that it was impossible to move her. Wherefore the Prefect ordered her to be covered over with pitch, resin, and boiling oil, and a fire to be kindled round her. But seeing that the flame was not permitted to hurt her, they tormented her in many cruel ways, and at length ran a sword through her neck. Thus wounded, Lucy fore- told the peace of the Church, which would come after the deaths of Dioclesian and Maximian, and then died. It was the Ides of Decem- ber (Dec. 13). Her body was buried at Syracuse, but was translated thence first to Constantinople, and after- wards to Venice.

Quam quum Paschasius interrogasset : Estne in te Spiritus Sanctus 1 Kespon- dit : Caste et pie viventes templum sunt Spiritus Sanc- ti. At ille : Jubebo te ad lupanar duci, ut te Spiritus Sanctus deserat. Cui Virgo : Si invitam jusseris violari, castitas mihi duplicabitur ad coronam. Quare Paschasius ira inflammatus Luciam eo trahi jussit, ubi ejus virgini- tas violaretur : sed divinitus factum est, ut firm a Virgo ita consisteret, ut nulla vi de loco dimoveri posset. Quam- obrem Praefectus circum ip- sam pice, resina, ac ferventi oleo perf usam, ignem accendi imperavit ; sed quum ne flamma quidem earn lsederet, multis tormentis excruciate guttur gladio transfigitur.

ADVENT.

We here give some of the Antiphons which occur in the Office of the Saint : they form a lyric poem of great beauty.

Orante sancta Lucia, ap- paruit ei beata Agatha, et con- solabatur ancillara Christi.

Lucia Virgo, quid a me petis, quod ipsa poteris prsestare continuo matri tuse?

Per te, Lucia Virgo, civitas Syracusana decorabitur a Domino Jesu Christo.

Benedico te, Pater Domini mei Jesu Christi, quia per Filium tuum ignis exstinctus est a latere meo.

In tua patientia possedisti animam tuam, Lucia, sponsa Christi : odisti quae in mun- do sunt, et coruscas cum Angelis : sanguine proprio inimicum vicisti.

As Lucy was praying, there appeared unto her the bless- ed Agatha, and she com- forted the handmaid of Christ.

O Virgin Lucy ! why ask- est thou of me, what thyself canst straightways grant unto thy mother 1

Because of thee, O Virgin Lucy ! the city of Syracuse shall be honoured- by the Lord Jesus Christ.

Words of Lacy : I bless thee, the Father of my Lord Jesus Christ, because by thy Son the fire was quenched that was around me.

In thy patience thou didst possess thy soul, O Lucy, Spouse of Christ ! thou didst hate the things that are in the world, and thou shinest among the Angels. Thou didst conquer the enemy by thine own blood.

We present ourselves before thee, 0 Virgin Mar- tyr, beseeching thee to obtain for us that we may recognise in his lowliness that same Jesus whom thou now seest in his glory. Take us under thy powerful patronage. Thy name signifies Light; guide us through the dark night of this life. O fair Light of Virginity ! enlighten us ; evil concupiscence has wounded our eyes : pray for us, 0 thou bright Light of Virginity ! that our blindness be healed, and that rising above created things, we may be able to see that true Light, which shineth in darkness, but which darkness cannot comprehend. Pray for us, that our

DEC. 13. ST. LUCY. 477

eye may be purified, and may see, in the Child who is to be born at Bethlehem, the new Man, the second Adam, the model on which the life of our regenera- tion must be formed. Pray, too, O holy Virgin, for the Church of Rome and for all those which adopt her form of the Holy Sacrifice ; for they daily pro- nounce at the Altar of God thy sweet name, and the Lamb, who is present, loves to hear it. Heap thy choicest blessings on the fair Isle, which was thy native land, and where grew the palm of thy martyr- dom. May thy intercession secure to her inhabitants firmness of faith, purity of morals, and temporal prosperity, and deliver them from the disorders which threaten her with destruction.

478 ADVENT.

THE SAME DAY.

ST. ODILIA, VIRGIN AND ABBESS.

On this same day, we have also the fifth of the Wise Virgins, whose bright lamps light us, during Advent, to the crib of Jesus, their Spouse. Odilia did not shed her blood for him, as did Bibiana, Barbara, Eulalia, and Lucy; her offering was her tears and her love. Her wreath of lilies blends sweetly with the roses, which form the crowns of her four com- panions. Her name is held in special veneration in the east of France, and beyond the Rhine. The holy hill whereon her tomb has rested now these thousand years, is still visited by numerous and devout pilgrims. Several Kings of the Capetian race, and several Emperors of the House of Hapsburg, were descendants of the father of our Saint, Adalric or Atticus, Duke of Alsace.

Odilia was born blind. Her father insisted on her being removed from the house, for her presence would have been a continual humiliation to him. It seems as though this affliction was permitted by Providence, in order that the action and power of divine grace might be the more clearly manifested in her regard. The little exile was taken from her mother, and placed in a monastery. God, who designed to show the virtue of the holy sacrament of regenera- tion, permitted that her baptism should be deferred until she had reached her thirteenth year. The time at length came for Odilia to be made a Child of God. No sooner was she taken from the baptismal font, than she recovered her eye-sight, which was but a

DEC. 13. ST. ODILIA. 479

feeble figure of the light which faith had lit tip in her soul. This prodigy restored Odilia to her father and to the world; and from that time forward, she had to defend, against unceasing attacks, the virginity which she had vowed to God. Her personal beauty, and her father's wealth and power, attracted to her many rich suitors. She refused them all; and her father himself built a Monastery on the rocks of Hohenburg, wherein she served her divine Lord, governed a large community, and gave relief to every sort of suffering.

After a long life spent in prayer, penance, and works of mercy, the day came which was to reward her for it all. It was this very day, the thirteenth of December, the feast of the holy virgin Lucy. The Sisters of Hohenburg, desirous of treasuring up her last words, assembled round their saintly Abbess. She was in an ecstasy, and already dead to the things of this life. Fearing lest she should die before she had received that holy Viaticum, which leads the soul to Him who is her last end, the Sisters thought it their duty to rouse her from the mystic sleep, which, so it seemed to them, rendered her forgetful of the duties which she had to perform. Being thus brought to herself, she turned to the community, and said to them : " Dear Sisters, why have you disturbed " me ? Why would you again oblige me to feel the " weight of this corruptible body, when I had once " left it ? By the favour of his divine Majesty, I " was in the company of the virgin Lucy, and the " delights I was enjoying were so great that no " tongue could tell them, nor ear hear them, nor " human eye see them." No time was lost in giving her the Bread of life and the Chalice of salvation, which having received, she immediately rejoined her heavenly companion, and the thirteenth day of De- cember thus united into one the feasts of the Abbess of Hohenburg and of the Martyr of Syracuse.

ADVENT.

The Church of Strasburg, which honours Odilia as one of its greatest glories, has the following Lessons for this feast. By giving them a place here, we do not adopt the statement they contain with regard to the Rule which was followed in the Monastery of Hohenburg. Mabillon, who proves that St. Odilia followed the Rule of St. Benedict, shows that the Canonical Rule, as it was called, did not exist at that time.

Odilia, suae decus et pre- sidium patriae, Attici Alsatiae ducis et Beresindse primo- genita soboles fuit ; sed quod csecis oculis nata esset, a patre repudiatam, mater hu- manior clam nutrici alendam tradidit. Post in Balmensi parthenio haud procul Veson- tione educata, divinisque erudita litteris crevit setate et sapientia. Jam adulta, dum a Beato Erhardo Prse- sule baptizatur, visum mira- culo accepit. Interjectis ali- quot annis, paternam in do- mum et gratiam reducitur. Ibi quidquid mundus amat despiciens, inter amplissi- mas opes paupertatis amo- rem, in medio aulas tumultu solitudinem anachoretarum retinebat ; nuptiasque con- stanter aversata, post longum et acre certamen a patre obtinuit, ut sibi liceret cum aliis virginibus Deo se in per- petuum consecrare. Quare Atticus in vertice excelsi montis sacram sedem et mo- nasterium sere suo excitavit, latos eidem fundos et prsedia concessit. Odiliamque ei re- gendo prseposuit.

Odilia, the glory and the protectress of her country, was the eldest child of Adal- ric, Duke of Alsace, and of Beresind his wife. Being born blind, she was repu- diated by her father ; but the mother, with more com- passion, had her nursed pri- vately. Later on, she was sent to the Monastery of Baume, not far from Besancon, where she was educated, and in- structed in the holy Scrip- tures, and grew in age and wisdom. When an adult, she was baptised by the holy Bishop Erhard, and was on that occasion miraculously cured of her blindness. After the lapse of some years, she was recalled to her father's house, and became the object of his affection. During this time, she despised all that the world loves, preferring poverty to the greatest wealth, and leading a hermit's life, amidst all the distractions of her father's palace. She re- jected, with great resolution, all the offers of marriage which were made to her, and, after a long and hard contest,

DEC. 13. ST. ODILIA.

481

obtained her father's consent to devote herself for ever to God, with several other vir- gins. For this end, Adalric built, at his own cost, a church and monastery on the top of a high hill, and richly- endowed it with land and possessions. It was at his request that Odilia was ap- pointed to govern the monas- tery.

Scarce was this abode of sanctity established, when many sought for admission, and, as it is related, the com- munity numbered no less than a hundred and thirty. At the commencement, no special rule was followed ; the imitation of Odilia was their rule. When afterwards, it was deliberated on which of the two rules should be adopted, the Monastic or the Canonical, this latter was preferred by the discreet Ab- bess, as being better adapted to the circumstances of the place.

To all around her she was indulgent : to herself alone she was severe. Her only food was barley-bread and water, to which she sometimes added a few herbs. Her con- templation of divine things was continual ; she gave to it the greatest part of the night, and spent the rest in sleep. Her bed was a rough skin, and a stone her pillow.

To this she added a mater- nal solicitude for the poor and sick, for whom she built ano- ther monastery, and also a

Deliberantibus postmodo cui- nam se regulae addicerent, monasticae an canonicae ; sa- pientissima praeses suadente loci natura, hanc alteri prae- tulit.

Cum vero esset in omnes lenis, se solam durius arcta- bat ; pane hordeaceo et aqua, subinde modico legumine, tolerabat vitam. In rerum divinarum contemplatione defixa, vigilabat majorem noctis partem ; quod supe- rerat, quieti datum : pellis hirsuta pro lecto, saxum pro pulvinari erat.

clivo extruxit, quo facilius amictae suae fortunae perfu- gium invenirent. Illic non solum sacras virgines collo- cavit, quae operani suam na- varent miseris ; sed etiam ipsa quotidie eos invisebat, cibis, solatiis refocillabat, neque pavebat leprosorum ulcera suis manibus fovere. Tandem meritis annisque gravis, quum se morti vici- nani intelligent, suas sodales in sacellum sancti Johannis Baptistae convocat : hortatur ut pii propositi tenaces arc- tiorem cceli viam nunquam deserant. Accepto deinde ibidem corporis et sanguinis Christi Viatico, vita cessit Idibus Decembris, anno, ut probabilius traditur, septin- gentesimo vigesimo.

large hospital at the foot of the hill, that so they might have readier assistance in their various miseries. She placed there several of the nuns to take care of the poor inmates ; not only so, but she, every day, visited them her- self, fed them, and comforted them, and hesitated not to dress with her own hands the loathsome sores of lepers. At length, weighed down by age and merit, and knowing that her death was at hand, she assembles her sisters in the oratory of St. John the Bap- tist, and there exhorts them to continue firm to their holy engagements, and never to leave the narrow path which leads to heaven. Having re- ceived, in the same place, the Viaticum of the Body and Blood of Christ*, she departed this life on the Ides of De- cember (Dec. 13), and accord- ing to the more probable opi- nion, in the year seven hun- dred and twenty. The body of the holy Virgin was buried in the same oratory, and her tomb became immediately an object of the greatest vene- ration of the faithful, and was celebrated for the miracles which were wrought there.

The ways of God in thy regard, 0 holy Virgin, were admirable indeed, and he manifested in thee the riches and the power of grace. He deprived thee of sight, that so thy soul might the more eagerly cling to his own infinite beauty ; and when afterwards he restored thee thy bodily vision, thou hadst already made choice of the better part. The harshness of

DEC. 13. ST. ODILIA. 483

thy father deprived thee of the innocent pleasures of home ; but it prepared thee to become the spiritual mother of so many noble virgins, who, following thy example, trampled on all the vanities of the world. Thou diclst choose a life of humility, because thy heavenly Spouse Jesus had humbled himself for our sakes. Thou didst imitate him also in his being our divine Deliverer, and taking upon himself all our miseries, for thou hadst the tenderest compassion on the poor and the sick. Thou didst take on thyself the care of a poor leper, that had been abandoned by all else ; with a mother's courage thou didst feed him, and affectionately dress his loathsome sores. And is it not this that our Jesus is coming down from heaven to do for us ; to heal our wounds by embrac- ing our human nature, and to nourish us with that food, which he is preparing to give us at Bethlehem ? Whilst the leper was receiving thy loving care, the frightful disease, which excluded him from the society of his fellow-creatures, suddenly disappeared ; a de- licious odour came from his whole person, whereas before, none but a saint like thyself could have borne to approach him. Is it not this which Jesus is coming down to do for us \ The leprosy of sin was upon us ; his grace heals us, and man regenerated sheds around him the good odour of Christ.1

In the midst of the joys which thou art now sharing- with Lucy, remember us, 0 thou that wast ever so compassionate to the needy ! We cannot forget the tears which thou didst shed, and the prayers thou didst offer up for the soul of thy father after his death, and by which thou didst deliver him from purgatory, and open the gates of heaven to him that had banished thee from his house. Thou art no longer in the land of tears ; but thine eyes are opened to the light of heaven and contemplate God in his glory ; pray there-

fore for us, for thy prayers are now more powerful than heretofore. Think of us who are poor and in- firm ; obtain the cure of our maladies. The Emma- nuel, who is coming to us, tells us that he is the Physician of our souls, for he has said : " The}r that ■ are in health need not the Physician, but they that " are ill."1 Ask him that he cure us of the leprosy of sin, and make us become even like unto himself. Pray for France, thy country, and help her to main- tain the purity of the Catholic faith. Watch over the ruins of the Holy Empire. Heresy has disunited the members of that great body ; but it will once more flourish, if our Lord, propitiated by such prayers as thine, vouchsafe to bring Germany back again to the true faith and to submission to the Church. Yes, pray that these glorious things be brought about for the honour and glory of thy Divine Spouse, and that nations, now weary of their errors and disunion, m"ay unite together in propagating the Kingdom of God upon earth.

Let us consider the Ever Blessed Mother of God leaving her humble dwelling at Nazareth, in order to visit her cousin, St. Elizabeth. The Church honours this Mystery of the Visitation on the Friday in Ember Week of Advent, as we have mentioned above, in the Proper of the Time. We will let St. Bonaventure relate this sublime incident of Mary's life, convinced that our readers will be pleased to hear the Seraphic Doctor revealing to them, with his wonderful unction, these preludes to the Birth of Jesus.

'■ After this, our Lady, pondering the words spoken unto her by the Angel concerning her cousin Eliza- beth, resolved to visit her, that she might congratu- late with her and render her service. She, therefore,

1 St. Matth. ix. 12.

DEC. 13. ST. ODILIA. 485

together with Joseph her Spouse, set out from "Naza- reth for the house of Elizabeth, which might perhaps be fourteen or fifteen miles distant from Jerusalem. Neither the roughness nor the length of the journey discouraged her ; but she walked with haste, foras- much as she wished to be little seen in public. She was not, like other mothers, burdened by her Child, nor was it to be thought that the Lord Jesus would be a burthen to his Mother. See, therefore, how the Queen of heaven and earth takes this journey alone, with none but her Spouse Joseph ; not riding, but walking ; neither is she escorted by troops of soldiers and barons, nor attended by handmaids and fine ladies. Her train is poverty, humility, modesty, and the beauty of all virtues. The Lord himself, too, is with her ; and he verily hath a numerous and honour- able suite, but it is not that of the world, vain and pompous.

" Now, when she had entered the house of Eliza- beth, she greeted her saying : Hail ! my Sister Eliza- beth! But she, exulting, and all full of joy, and inflamed by the Holy Spirit, rises and most tenderly embraces Mary, exclaiming for joy : Blessed art thou among women, and blessed is the fruit of thy womb ! And whence is this to me, that there should come unto me the Mother of my Lord ? For as soon as the Virgin had greeted Elizabeth, John, in his mother's womb, was filled with the Holy Ghost, as was likewise the mother. Nor was it that the mother was filled and then her child, but contrariwise, the child was filled firsthand he communicated the Spirit unto the mother. The babe effected nought in Elizabeth's soul, but he merited that the Holy Ghost should do a work in her soul, because the grace of the Divine Spirit had descended into him with greater abundance, and he was the first to receive the grace. And as Elizabeth had perceived the coming of Mary, so did John per- ceive the coming of Jesus. Therefore was it, that he

486

leaped for joy, and she prophesied. See the virtue of our Lady's words, when by their utterance there is conferred the Holy Ghost ; for so replenished was Mary with Him, that, by her merits, he filled others also with himself. Upon this, Mary made answer unto Elizabeth, saying: My soul doth magnify the Lord, and my spirit hath rejoiced in God my Sa- viour."

Happy day this ! for on it we make commemoration of Mary, the Mother of God.

Let us sing to-day the praises and the dignity of the ever Blessed Virgin Mary.

Here was the prophecy fulfilled ; that a garden should flower under the breath of the south zephyr ; that all its gates were closed, and no man could enter.

Mary is the earth spoken of as enriched with the dew of heaven ; she is, as Gedeon's fleece prefigured her, filled with the dew of the God- head.

December 14. THE SEVENTH DAY WITHIN THE OCTAVE

OF THE IMMACULATE CONCEPTION.

Let us consider how our Blessed Lady, having arrived at the house of her holy cousin Elizabeth, rendered her every possible service with the greatest love, favoured her with her sweet and holy conversa- tions, assisted at the glorious Birth of St. John the Baptist, and at length returned home to her humble dwelling at Nazareth. But, that we may the better enter into these divine mysteries, let us again listen to the Seraphic St. Bonaventure :

" When, therefore, her time was expired, Elizabeth gave birth to a son, whom our Lady took up, and with all diligence did what was required. The babe looked into Mary's face like one that knew her ; and as she gave him unto his mother, he turned his head towards Mary, for he fain would be in her arms again. Mary, on her part, delighted in nursing this holy babe, and fondled him, and kissed him with great joy. Consider the honour that is here given unto John. Never had child such arms as these to carry him. Many other privileges are related as being granted unto him ; but for this present, I must needs pass them by.

" Now, on the eighth day, the child was circum- cised, and was called John. Then was the mouth

Blessed be the Lord God of Israel! Thus were made, in that house, the two most beautiful Can- ticles, namely, the Magnificat and the Benedictus. Meanwhile, our Lady going aside, lest she should be seen by those that had come together for the cere- mony, listened attentively to the Canticle of Zachary, which prophesied of her Son, and most prudently pondered in her heart upon all these things. At length, when the time came for her to return home, she bade Elizabeth and Zachary farewell, and giving John her blessing, she returned unto Nazareth. Recal to thy mind, in this her second journey, all that was told thee of her poverty. She returned to her house, where she would find neither bread, nor wine, nor those things which were needed. She had no property, nor money. She had been, now these three months, living with persons who were very rich ; but now she returns unto her poor cottage, and has to procure her live- lihood by the labour of her hands. Do thou sym- pathise with her, and learn to love poverty."

THE OCTAVE OF THE IMMACULATE CONCEPTION

OF THE MOST BLESSED VIRGIN.

This, the eighth day from that on which we kept the Feast of the Immaculate Conception, is the Octave properly so called ; whereas the other days were simply called days within the Octave. The custom of keeping up the principal Feasts for a whole week, is one of those which the Christian Church adopted from the Synagogue. God had thus spoken in the Book of Leviticus : " The first day shall be called " most solemn and most holy, you shall do no servile " work therein. . . . The eighth day also shall be " most solemn and most holy, and you shall offer " holocausts to the Lord, for it is the day of assembly " and congregation ; you shall do no servile work " therein."1 We also read in the Book of Kings, that Solomon having called all Israel to Jerusalem, for the dedication of the Temple, suffered not the people to return home until the eighth day.

We learn from the Books of the New Testament that this custom was observed in our Saviour's time, and we find him authorising, by his own example, this solemnity of the Octave. Thus, we read in Saint John, that Jesus once took part in one of the Jewish Festivals, about the midst of the Feast ;2 of Zachary opened, and he prophesied, saying :

1 Lev. xxiii. 35, 36. 2 St. John, vil 14.

DEC. 15. OCTAVE OF THE IMMACULATE CONCEPTION. 493

and the same Evangelist relating how our Lord cried out to the people : If any man thirst, let him come to me, and drink : observes, that it was on the last and great day of the festivity}

In the Christian Church, there are two kinds of Octaves : Privileged Octaves, and Non-privileged Octaves. The first are so solemn, that no feast of a Saint, occurring during them, can be kept, but mast be transferred to some other time, out of the Octave. Neither, during these Octaves, can a Mass De Requiem be said, unless the corpse be present for burial. Non-privileged Octaves admit the Feasts of Saints, which occur during them, provided they are semi-doubles or of higher class; but a com- memoration of the Octave must be made both in the Office and the Mass of the Feast, which thus takes precedence of the Octave, unless this Feast be itself one of a first or second Class.

The Octave of the Immaculate Conception, the first that occurs in the Liturgical Year, is not pri- vileged. It gives place, not only to the Sunday, but also to the feasts of St. Damasus and St. Lucy, and to the various local feasts which are of a double or semi-double rite.

Let us once more devoutly reverence the Mystery of Mary's Immaculate Conception : our Emmanuel loves to see his Mother honoured. After all, is it not for him and for his sake that this Bright Star was prepared from all eternity, and created when the happy time fixed by the divine decree came ? When we honour the Immaculate Conception of Mary, it is really to the divine Mystery of the Incarnation that we are paying our just homage. Jesus and Mary cannot be separated, for Isaias tells us that She is the Branch, and He the Flower.2

We give thee thanks, O Jesus our Emmanuel

because thou hast granted us to live during the time that the privilege of thy Blessed Mother was pro- claimed on this earth ; the glorious privilege -where- with thou didst enrich the first instant of the life of the happy creature, from whom thou didst take upon thyself our human nature ! This Definition of thy Church has given us a clearer knowledge of thine infinite holiness. It has taught us to see more distinctly the harmony there is in all thy divine mysteries. But it also has impressed upon us the great truth, that we ourselves, being destined to the most intimate union with thee here, and to the face-to-face vision of thy infinite Majesty hereafter, must labour without ceasing to purify ourselves from the smallest stains of sin. Thou hast said : Blessed are the clean of heart for they shall see God;1 and thou showest us, by the dogma of thy Blessed Mother's Immaculate Conception, what is the purity which thy sovereign sanctity demands of us. Ah ! by the love, which led thee to preserve her from every stain of sin, have mercy on us who are her devoted children. Thou art so soon to be among us ! Before many days are past, we shall have yielded to thy invitations, and have presumed to approach thy sacred Crib. We are not yet ready, dear Jesus ! The effects of original sin are still so plainly upon us, and, what is worse, there are so many of our own sins, which we have added to this of our first parent : Oh ! prepare our hearts and our senses, for we will not approach to Bethlehem unworthily. The sinless purity of thy Mother is not for us ; we ask not for that ; but we ask for forgiveness of our countless sins, for con-, version, for hatred of the world and the world's maxims, and for perseverance in thy holy love.

O Mary S created Mirror of divine Justice, and. purer than the Cherubim and Seraphim, in return for

the homage paid thee by this our generation, on that blissful day when the glory of thy Immaculate Con- ception was proclaimed throughout the world, give us that abundant richness of thy protecting love, which thou didst reserve till now. The world is shaken to its very foundations : thy hand can help it to rest again. Hell has let loose upon mankind the most terrible of its spirits of wickedness, who breathe but blasphemy and destruction ; but, at the same time, the Church of thy Jesus feels that her youth has been renewed within her, and that the seed of the divine word is broadcast and healthy in a thousand fresh portions of the earth. Never was the battle more fierce on both sides : so that we need all our hope to make us feel that hell will not prevail. Is this the great struggle, which is to be followed by the day of judgment ?

O Blessed Mother of Jesus ! O Queen of the universe ! can it be that the Star of thy Immaculate Conception has shone in the heavens only to light up the ruin and wreck of this earth ? The sign fore- told by the Beloved Disciple St. John, of the Woman that appeared in the heavens clad with the Sun, bearing on her head a crown of twelve stars, and crushing the Crescent beneath her feet1 — has it not more brightness and power than that other, which appeared in the heavens telling men that God's anger was appeased, and that the deluge was over ? The light which shines upon us is from a Mother. It is our Mother that comes to console and heal us. It is heaven that smiles upon poor guilty earth. We have deserved the chastisement we have received, and more than we have received : but, the anger of God will give way, and he will spare us.

The graces which God poured out upon the world on that great Day of the Church's Definition of Mary's Immaculate Conception, were not to be without their

effect ; a new period then commenced. Mary, on whom heresy had heaped its blasphemies for three hundred years, will again reign in the love of those whom her Son redeemed; countries will abandon those errors which have made them slaves and dupes of men's doctrines; the old serpent will again writhe under that crushing pressure which God set up from the beginning ; and the divine Sun of Justice will pour out on the regenerated world the floods of a light, more than ever dazzling and resplendent. We may not live to see that time ; but we have signs of its - near approach.

It was in the last century, that thy devout servant whom the Church has placed upon her altars, Leonard of Porto-Maurizio, predicted that when this dogma of thy Immaculate Conception should be defined, the world would enjoy a long period of peace. The troubles of the present time in which we are living are, we doubt not, a prelude to that happy peace, during which the divine word will traverse the whole world unimpeded, and the Church militant will reap her harvest for the Church in heaven. Sweet Mother of our Jesus ! the world was also in agitation in those times which preceded the Birth of thy divine Son ; but peace reigned throughout the whole earth, when thou didst give it its Saviour in Bethlehem. Until that grand time come, when thou wilt show to the world the magnificence of the power which God has given to thee, assist us, each year, to prepare for the glorious solemnity of Christmas : oh ! pray for us, * that we may be cleansed from all our sins when that splendid Night comes, during which will be born of thee Jesus Christ, the Son of God, the Light eternal.

Cor devotum elevetur, Let every heart, that is

devoutly celebrate the Con- ception of the Virgin ever blessed.

Let the mind be inflamed with love ; and let praise and jubilee unite with the love.

In her admirable Concep- tion, she is a rose in its beauty, she is a lily in its whiteness.

As fruit that comes from the flower, so was Mary brought forth in her purity, for her Son had possession of her from the first.

As a dew-drop contracts not a stain from the earth whereon 'tis formed,

So was Mary untainted by original sin when she was conceived in her mother's womb.

Let us then sing our sweet- est hymn in praise of a cloud- less brightness, the Immacu- late Conception.

Put on all your joy, ye choirs of earth, and sing of her, that was a daughter of Adam, but not of his sin.

May she be pleased with our hymns, and defend us from all sin in this our pre- sent life,

And when our last hour comes, deliver us by her prayers from the abyss of hell into which the devil will seek to drag us.

Amen.

Virginis Conceptio.

Mens amore inflammetur Et amori copuletur Laus et jubilatio.

Sicut ros non corrumpitur, Quando in terra gignitur Elementi rubigine ;

Sic Virgo non inficitur, Quum in matre concipitur, Originali crimine.

Nos ergo dulci carmine, Laudemus in hac Virgine Conceptum sine nubilo.

Hanc conceptam ex se- mine, Et mundam ab origin e, Laudet chorus cum jubilo.

DEC. 16. ST. EUSEBIUS. 499

December 16. SAINT EUSEBIUS, BISHOP OF VERCELLI,

AND MARTYR.

When asked to tell the names of the Saints who were foremost in defending the dogma of the Incar- nation, we think at once of the intrepid Eusebius of Vercelli, as one of the glorious number. The Catholic faith, which was so violently attacked, in the fourth century, by the Arian heresy, was maintained at that time by the labours and zeal of four Sove- reign Pontiffs : Sylvester, who confirmed the decrees of the Council of Nicasa ; Julius, the supporter of St. Athanasius; Liberius, whose faith failed not, and who, when restored to his liberty, confounded the Arians ; and, lastly, Damasus, who destroyed the last hopes of the heretics. One of these four Pon- tiffs appears on our Advent Calendar, — Damasus, whose feast we kept but a few days since. The four Popes have for their fellow-combatants, in this battle for the Divinity of the Incarnate Word, four great Bishops, of whom it may be said, that the defence of the dogma of the Consubstantiality of the Son of God was what they lived for, and that to say anathema to them was to say anathema to Christ himself ; all four most powerful in word and work, lights of the Churches of the world, objects of the people's love, and the dauntless witnesses of Jesus. The first and greatest of the four is the Bishop of the second See

500 ADVENT.

of Christendom, St. Athanasius, the Patriarch of Alexandria ; the second is St. Ambrose of Milan, whose feast we kept on the seventh of this month ; the third is the glory of Gaul, St. Hilary, Bishop of Poitiers; the fourth is the ornament of Italy, St. Eusebius, Bishop of Vercelli, whom we have to honour to-day. Hilary will come to us during Christmas- tide, and will stand at the Crib of the Word, whose Divinity he so bravely confesses ; Athanasius will meet us at Easter, and help us to celebrate, in the triumphant Resurrection, Him whom he pro- claimed as God in those dark times, when human wis- dom hoped to destroy, by a fifty years of peace, that Church which had survived the storm of three cen- turies of persecution. St. Eusebius' place is Advent; and divine Providence has thus chosen him as one of the patrons of the faithful during this mystic season ; his powerful prayers will help us to come devoutly to Bethlehem, and see in the Child, that is lying there, the eternal Word of God. So great were the suffer- ings which St. Eusebius had to undergo for the Divi- nity of Jesus, that the Church awards him the honours of a Martyr, although he did not actually shed his blood. Let us now listen to the admirable account which the Church gives us of his life.

first saw him. Eusebius was the first of the Bishops in the Western Church, who estab- lished Monks in his Church to exercise the functions of the Clergy ; he did it in order that he might thus unite, in the same persons, the detach- ment from riches and the dignity of Levites. It was during this time that the im- pious doctrines of the Arians were devastating the whole of the West ; and so vigor- ously did Eusebius attack them, that Pope Liberius' greatest consolation was the unflinching faith of this holy man. It was on this account, that the same Pope, knowing that the Spirit of God burned in Eusebius' soul, commis- sioned him to go, accompa- nied by his Legates, to the Emperor, and plead the cause of the true Faith. Eusebius and the Legates being come before Constantius, the Saint pleaded so powerfully, that the Emperor granted what he asked, namely, that a council of the Bishops should be convened.

That Council was held the following year, at Milan ; Eusebius was invited by Con- stantius to be present at it, which was what the Legates of Liberius had desired and begged. So far was he from being duped by the synagogue of the malicious Arians to side with them against St. Athanasius, that he openly declared from the first that several of those

Arianis impietatibus ea teni- pestate per Occidentem longe lateque traductis, adversus eas viriliter sic dimicavit, ut ejus invicta fides Liberium, summum Pontificem, ad vitas solatium erigeret. Quare hie sciens, in ipso fervere Spiri- tum Dei, quum ei significas- set ut penes Imperatorem, una cum suis legatis patroci- nium Fidei susciperet, mox cum illis profectus est ad Constantium, apud quern enixius agens, quidquid lega- tione petebatur, obtinuit, ut Episcoporum nempe ccetus celebraretur.

Quanta in eum tunc Aria- norum crudelitas fuerit, ac effrons inverecundia, osten- dunt graves litterae plense rob oris, pietatis ac religionis, quas e Scythopoli scripsit ad Vercellensem clerum et po- pulum, aliosque finitimos, e

present were known to him to be heretics, and he there- fore proposed that they should subscribe to the Nicene Creed before proceeding any fur- ther. This the Arians, infu- riated with anger, refused to do ; whereupon, he not only refused to subscribe to what was drawn up against Atha- nasius, but he also, by a most ingenious device, succeeded in having the name of St. Denis the Martyr blotted out from the decree, which the craft of the Arians had in- duced him to sign. Where- fore, they being exceeding angry against Eusebius, loaded him with injuries, and had him sent into banish- ment. The holy man, on his side, shaking off the dust from his feet, caring little either for the threats of the Emperor, or the sword which was held over him, submit- ted to banishment as to some- thing which belonged to his episcopal office. Being sent to Scythopolis, he there en- dured hunger, thirst, blows, and sundry other punish- ments ; he generously de- spised his life for the true faith, feared not death, and gave up his body to the exe- cutioners.

How much he had to put up with from the cruelty and insolence of the Arians, we learn from the admirable let- ters, full of energy, piety, and religion, which he addressed, from Scythopolis, to the clergy and people of Yercelli,

and to other persons of the neighbouring country. It is , evident from these letters that the heretics were unable, either by their threats or by their inhuman treatment, to shake his constancy, or to in- duce him by the craft of their flattery or arguments to join their party. Thence he was taken into Cappadocia, and lastly into Thebais of Upper Egypt, in punishment of his refusing to yield. Thus did he suffer the hardships of exile until the death of Con- stantius : after which he was allowed to return to his flock; but this he would not do, until he had assisted at the Council which was being held at Alexandria for the purpose of repairing the injuries done by heresy. This done, he travelled through the pro- vinces of the East, endea- vouring, like a clever physi- cian, to restore to perfect health such as were weak in the faith, by instructing them in the doctrine of the Church. Animated by the like zeal for the salvation of souls, he passed over into Illyricum ; and having at length returned to Italy, that country put off its mourning. He there pub- lished the commentaries of Origen and Eusebius of Cse- sarea on the Psalms, which two works he translated from the Greek into Latin, with such corrections as were needed. At length, having rendered himself celebrated by a life spent in such actions

as these, lie died at Vercelli, in the reign of Valentinian and Valens, and went to re- ceive the immortal crown of glory which his so many and great sufferings had merited for him.

Valiant Soldier of Jesus, Eusebius, Martyr and Pontiff, how much labour and suffering thou didst undergo for the Messias ! And yet, they seemed to thee to be little in comparison with what is due to this eternal Word of the Father, who, out of his pure love, has made himself the Servant of his own crea- tures, by becoming Man for them in the mystery of the Incarnation. We owe the same debt of gratitude to this divine Saviour. He is born in a stable for our sakes, as he was for thine ; pray, therefore, for us that we may be ever faithful to him both in war and peace ; and that we may resist our temptations and evil inclinations with that same firmness, wherewith we would confess his name before tyrants and perse- cutors. Obtain for the Bishops of our holy Mother the Church, such vigilance, that no false doctrines may surprise them, and such courage that no perse- cution may make them yield. May they be faithful imitators of the divine Pastor, who gives his life for his sheep ; and may they ever feed the flock, in- trusted to them, in the unity and charity of Jesus Christ.

Let us consider how our Blessed Lady, having re- turned to Nazareth, is overwhelmed with joy to feel living within her Him, who gives being to every created thing, and whom she loves with all the in- tensity of the Mother of God. Joseph, the faithful guardian of her virginity, tenderly loves this his Spouse, and blesses God for having intrusted such a treasure to his keeping. The Angels crowd round

DEC. 16. ST. EUSEBIUS. 505

this favoured house wherein dwell their sovereign Lord, and she whom he has chosen to be his Mother. Never was there happiness like that which fills this little dwelling ; and yet, God has decreed to visit it with a heavy trial, in order that he may give an occa- sion to Mary to exercise heroic patience, and to Joseph an occasion of meriting by his exquisite prudence. Let us listen to the Meditation of St. Bona venture, in which he thus ponders the Gospel narrative :

"Bat while our Lady and Joseph her Spouse were thus dwelling together, the Infant Jesus grew within his Mother's womb. Then Joseph perceiving that Mary was with Child, he was above all measure grieved. Here give, I pray thee, all thine attention, for thou hast many fair things to learn. If thou wouldst know wherefore it was that our Lord wished that his Mother should have a husband, whereas he always wished that she should be a Virgin, I answer thee that he so wished on three accounts : firstly, that she might not be disgraced when it was seen that she was a Mother : secondly, that she might have Joseph's aid and company ; and thirdly, that the birth of the Son of God might be concealed from the devil.

" Now, Joseph did look many times on Mary, and grief and trouble of heart fell upon him, and his displeasure was seen in his face, and he turned his eyes away from her as one that was guilty of that which he perforce suspected. See how God permits his servants to be afflicted and sorely tried, that they may so receive their crown. Now, Joseph was minded to put her away privately. In very truth may it be said of this holy man, that his praise is in the Gospel, for the Gospel says of him that he was a just man, that is, a man of great virtue. For albeit they say, that no shame, nor suffering, nor insult can befal a man so grievous as that of his wife's unfaith- fulness ; yet did Joseph restrain himself withal, and would not accuse Mary, but bore this great injury

506 ADVENT.

patiently. He sought not bow to avenge himself, but, overcome with pity, and wishing to forgive, he was minded to put her away privately. But herein also had our Lady her share of tribulation, for she took notice of Joseph's trouble, and it sorely grieved her. Yet did she humbly hold her peace, and hide the gift of God. Better did it seem unto her that evil should be thought of her, than that she should reveal the divine Mystery, and say aught of herself which would come nigh to boasting. Therefore did she beseech our Lord that himself would right this matter, and make pass this grief from Joseph and herself. Here thou mayest learn what great tribulation and anxiety was theirs. But God came unto their as- sistance.

" He therefore sent his Angel, who spake unto Joseph in his sleep, and told him that his Spouse had conceived of the Holy Ghost, and that he was to abide with her in all surety and joy. Whereupon, the tribulation ceased, and they were both exceedingly comforted. So likewise would it befal us if we would suffer patiently, for after a storm God brings a calm. Neither oughtest thou to doubt this, for God sufXereth not his servants to be afflicted save for their good. After this, Joseph requested our Lady to narrate unto him what had happened ; and she faithfully narrated all unto him. Whereupon Joseph remains with his Blessed Spouse, and lives with her in all contentment, and loves her above what words can say, and diligently provides her whatsoever she needed. So also our Lady continues to remain con- fidently with Joseph, and they live right joyfully in their poverty."

{The Mozarabic Breviary, Wednesday of the First Week of Advent, Capitula.)

O God, to whom the whole earth proclaims its glad praise ; whose glory is cele- brated in the sweet melody of the Psalms ; and whose mighty power is confessed by thy works ; make known thy Saviour unto all of us thy servants. Reveal thy justice, whereby we may ac- knowledge thee to be our Creator : and be mindful of thy mercy, whereby we may deserve to find the forgive- ness of our sins ; that seeing the Saviour whom thou sendest, we may hymn thee our hymns of joy, and sing our Psalms in gladness, and deserve to enjoy the reward of thy blessed sight.

December 17.

the commencement OF THE GREAT ANTIPHONS.

The Church enters to-day on the seven days, which, precede the Vigil of Christmas, and which are known in the Liturgy under the name of the Greater Ferias. The ordinary of the Advent Office becomes more solemn ; the Antiphons of the Psalms, both for Lauds and the Hours of the day, are proper, and allude ex- pressly to the great Coming. Every day, at Vespers, is sung a solemn Antiphon, which consists of a fervent prayer to the Messias, whom it addresses by one of the titles given him by the sacred Scriptures.

In the Roman Church, there are seven of these Antiphons, one for each of the Greater Ferias. They are commonly called the O's of Advent, because they all begin with that interjection. In other Churches, during the Middle Ages, two more were added to these seven ; one to our Blessed Lady, 0 Virgo Vir- ginum ; and the other to the Angel Gabriel, 0 Gabriel ; or to St. Thomas the Apostle, whose feast comes during the Greater Ferias ; it began 0 Thoma Didyme.1 There were even Churches, where twelve Great Antiphons were sung; that is, besides the nine we have just mentioned, there was 0 Rex Pacifice to our Lord, 0 Mundi Domino, to our Lady, and 0 Hierusalem to the city of the people of God.

1 It is more modern than the 0 Gabriel ; but dating from the 13th century, it was almost universally used in its stead.

dec. 17. 509

The canonical Hour of Vespers has been selected as the most appropriate time for this solemn suppli- cation to our Saviour, because, as the Church sings in one of her hymns, it was in the Evening of the world (vergente mundi vespere) that the Messias came amongst us. These Antiphons are sung at the Magnificat, to show us that the Saviour, whom we expect, is to come to us by Mary. They are sung twice ; once before and once after the Canticle, as on Double Feasts, and this to show their great solemnity. In some Churches it was formerly the practice to sing them thrice ; that is, before the Canticle, before the Gloria Patri, and after the Sicut erat. Lastly, these admirable Antiphons, which contain the whole pith of the Advent Liturgy, are accompanied by a chant replete with melodious gravity, and by ceremonies of great expressiveness, though, in these latter, there is no uniform practice followed. Let us enter into the spirit of the Church; let us reflect on the great Day which is coming ; that thus we may take our share in these the last and most earnest solicitations of the Church imploring her Spouse to come, and to which He at length yields.

This prince has no other object in this order, which sets the world in motion, but his own ambition. Men go to and fro by millions, and an unbroken pro- cession traverses the immense Roman world ; men think they are doing the bidding of man, and it is God whom they are obeying. This world-wide agi- tation has really but one object; it is. to bring to Bethlehem a man and woman who live at Nazareth in Galilee, in order that this woman, who is unknown to the world but dear to heaven, and is at the close of the ninth month since she conceived her child, may give birth to this Child in Bethlehem, for the Prophet has said of him : " His going forth is from " the beginning, from the days of eternity. And " thou, O Bethlehem ! art not the least among the " thousand cities of Juda, for out of thee He shall " come."1 O divine Wisdom ! how strong art thou, in thus reaching thine ends by means which are in- fallible, though hidden ! and yet, how sweet, offering no constraint to man's free-will ! and withal, how fatherly, in providing for our necessities ! Thou choosest Bethlehem for thy birth-place, because Bethlehem signifies the House of Bread. In this, thou teachest us that thou art our Bread, the nourishment and support of our life. With God as our food, we cannot die. O Wisdom of the Father, Living Bread that hast descended from heaven, come speedily into us, that thus we may approach to thee and be en- lightened2 by thy light, and by that prudence which leads to salvation.

O thou that didst come like a torrent to call the nations, and wast born on earth for the conversion of sinners, show unto us the gift of thy grace, whereby all fear being removed, we may ever follow thee by the chaste love of inward charity. Amen.

ISTativitatis tuae terrore et regna concutis, et reges ad- mirari compellis, praebe no- bis initium Sapientiae, quod est timor tuus ; ut in eo fruc- tificemur, in eo etiam profici- entes, fructum tibi pacatissi- mum offeramus : ut, qui ad gentium vocationem, quasi fluvius violentus, accessisti ; nasciturus in terris ad con- versionem peccantium, mani- festa tuae gratias donum : quo, repulso terrore formidinis, casto te semper sequamur amore intimae charitatis.

Israel, qui Moysi in igne the house of Israel, who ap-

flammae rubi apparuisti, et pearedst to Moses in the fire

ei in Sina legem dedisti ; of the flaming bush, and gav-

outstretched arm.

O Sovereign Lord ! 0 Adonai ! come and redeem us, not by thy power, but by thy humility. Heretofore, thou didst show thyself to Moses thy servant in the midst of a mysterious flame ; thou didst give thy law to thy people amidst thunder and lightning ; now, on the contrary, thou comest not to terrify, but to save us. Thy chaste Mother having heard the Emperor's edict, which obliges her and Joseph her Spouse to repair to Bethlehem, she prepares everything needed for thy divine Birth. She prepares for thee, O Sun of Justice! the humble swathing-bands, wherewith to cover thy nakedness, and protect thee, the Creator of the world, from the cold of that mid-night hour of thy Nativity ! Thus it is that thou wiliest to deliver us from the slavery of our pride, and show man that thy divine arm is never stronger than when he thinks it powerless and still. Everything is prepared, then, dear Jesus ! thy swathing-bands are ready for thy infant limbs ! come to Bethlehem, and redeem us from the hands of o ur enemies.

DEC. 18. EXPECTATION OF THE B. VIRGIN. 513

THE SAME DAY.

THE EXPECTATION

OF THE BLESSED VIRGIN MARY.

This Feast, which is now kept, not only throughout the whole of Spain, but in almost all the Churches of the Catholic world, owes its origin to the Bishops of the tenth Councirof Toledo, in 656. These Prelates having thought that there was an incongruity in the ancient practice of celebrating the feast of the Annun- ciation on the twenty-fifth of March, inasmuch as this joyful solemnity frequently occurs at the time when the Church is intent upon the Passion of our Lord, and is sometimes obliged to be transferred into Easter Time, with which it is out of harmony for another reason ;— they decreed that, henceforth, in the Church of Spain there should be kept, eight days before Christmas, a solemn Feast with an Octave, in honour of the Annunciation, and as a preparation for the great solemnity of our Lord's Nativity. In course of time, however, the Church of Spain saw the necessity of returning to the practice of the Church of Rome, and of those of the whole world, which solemnise the twenty-fifth of March as the day of our Lady's Annun- ciation and the Incarnation of the Son of God. But such had been, for ages, the devotion of the people for the Feast of the eighteenth of December, that it was considered requisite to maintain some vestige of it. They discontinued, therefore, to celebrate the Annunciation on this day ; but the faithful were

2 L

514 ADVENT.

requested to consider, with devotion, what must have been the sentiments of the Holy Mother of God during the days immediately preceding her giving him birth. A new Feast was instituted, under the name of the Expectation of the Blessed Virgins De- livery.

This Feast, which sometimes goes under the name of Our Lady of 0, or the Feast of 0, on account of the Great Antiphons which are sung during these days, and, in a special manner, of that which begins 0 Virgo Virginum (which is still used in the Vespers of the Expectation, together with the 0 Adonai, the Antiphon of the Advent Office,) — is kept with great devotion in Spain. A High Mass is sung, at a very early hour, each morning during the Octave, at which all who are with child, whether rich or poor, consider it a duty to assist, that they may thus honour our Lady's Maternity, and beg her blessing upon them- selves. It is not to be wondered at that the Holy See has approved of this pious practice being intro- duced into almost every other country. We find that the Church of Milan, long before Rome conceded this feast to the various dioceses of Christendom, celebrated the Office of our Lady's Annunciation on the sixth and last Sunday of Advent, and called the whole week following the Hebdomada de Exceptato (for thus the popular expression had corrupted the word Expectato). But these details belong strictly to the archaeology of Liturgy, and enter not into the plan of our present work ; let us, then, return to the Feast of our Lady's Expectation, which the Church has established and sanctioned as a new means of exciting the attention of the faithful during these last days of Advent.

Most just indeed it is, 0 Holy Mother of God, that we should unite in that ardent desire thou hadst to see Him, who had been concealed for nine months in thy chaste womb ; to know the features of this Son of the heavenly Father, who is also thine ; to come to that

DEC. 18. EXPECTATION OF THE B. VIRGIN. 515

blissful hour of his Birth, which will give Glory to God in the highest, and, on earth, Peace to men of good- will. Yes, dear Mother, the time is fast ap- proaching, though not fast enough to satisfy thy desires and ours. Make us redouble our attention to the great mystery ; complete our preparation by thy powerful prayers for us, that when the solemn hour is come, our Jesus may rind no obstacle to his entering into our hearts.

O Jesus, Son of David ! heir to his throne and his power ! thou art now passing over, in thy way to Bethlehem, the land that once was the kingdom of thy ancestor, but now is tributary to the Gentiles. Scarce an inch of this ground which has not witnessed the miracles of the justice and the mercy of Jehovah, thy Father, to the people of that old Covenant, which is so soon to end. Before long, when thou hast come from beneath the virginal cloud which now hides thee, thou wilt pass along this same road doing good,1 healing all manner of sickness and every infirmity? and yet having not where to lay thy head.3 Now, at least, thy Mother's womb affords thee the sweetest rest, and thou receivest from her the profoundest adoration and the tenderest love. But, dear Jesus, it is thine own blessed will that thou leave this loved abode. Thou hast, O Eternal Light, to shine in the midst of this world's darkness, this prison where the Captive, whom thou art come to deliver,

SAINT THOMAS, APOSTLE.

This is the last Feast the Church keeps before the great one of the Nativity of her Lord and Spouse. She interrupts the Greater Ferias in order to pay her tribute of honour to Thomas, the Apostle of Christ, whose glorious martyrdom has consecrated this twenty-first day of December, and has procured for the Christian people a powerful patron, that will introduce them to the divine Babe of Bethlehem. To none of the Apostles could this day have been so fittingly assigned as to St. Thomas. It was St. Thomas whom we needed ; St. Thomas, whose festal patronage would aid us to believe and hope in that God whom we see not, and who comes to us in silence and humility in order to try our Faith. St. Thomas was once guilty of doubting, when he ought to have believed ; and only learnt the necessity of Faith by the sad experience of incredulity : he comes then most appropriately to defend us, by the power of his example and prayers, against the temptations which

DEC. 21. ST. THOMAS.

521

proud human reason might excite within us. Let us pray to him "with confidence. In that heaven of Light and Vision, where his repentance and love have placed him, he will intercede for us, and gain for us that docility of mind and heart, which will enable us to see and recognise Him, who is the Expected of Nations, and who, though the King of the world, will give no other signs of his majesty, than the swaddling-clothes and tears of a Babe. But let us first read the Acts of our holy Apostle. The Church has deemed it prudent to give us them in an exceed- ingly abridged form, which contains only the most reliable facts, gathered from authentic sources ; and thus, she excludes all those details, which have no historic authority.

Thomas the Apostle, who was also named Didymus, was a Galilean. After he had received the Holy Ghost, he travelled through many pro- vinces, preaching the Gospel of Christ. He taught the principles of Christian faith and practice to the Parthians, Medes, Persians, Hircanians, and Bactrians. He finally went to the Indies, and in- structed the inhabitants of those countries in the Chris- tian religion. Up to the last, he gained for himself the es- teem of all men by the holi- ness of his life and teaching, and by the wonderful miracles he wrought. He stirred up, also, in their hearts, the love of Jesus Christ. The King of those parts, a worshipper of idols, was, on the contrary, only the more irritated by all these things. He condemned the Saint to be pierced to

O Thomas ! Didymus ! who didst merit to see Christ ; we beseech thee, by most earnest supplication, help us mise- rable sinners, lest we be con- demned with the ungodly, at the Coming of the Judge.

OEEMUS.

Da nobis, queesumus, Do- mine, beati Apostoli tui Thomas solemnitatibus glo- riari : ut ejus semper et pa- trociniis sublevemur, et Fi- dem congrua devotione sec- temur. Per Dominum, &c. Amen.

LET TJS PEAY.

Grant, O Lord, we beseech thee, that we may rejoice on the solemnity of thy blessed Apostle, Thomas ; to the end that we may always have the assistance of his prayers, and zealously profess the faith he taught. Through Jesus Christ our Lord. Amen.

The following Prayer is from the Matins of the Gothic, or Mozarabic, Breviary.

O Lord Jesus Christ, who hast placed on the head of thy Martyr, Thomas the Apostle, a crown made of that precious stone, that is founded in the foundation ; that so he might not be con- founded, because he believed in thee ; nor be uncrowned, because he laid down his life for thee ; may there be, by his intercession, in us thy ser- vants, that true Faith, where-

The Greek Church celebrates, with her usual solemnity, the Feast of St. Thomas ; but she keeps it on the sixth of October. We extract the following stanzas from her Hymns.

HYMN OF ST. THOMAS.

{Taken from the Mencea of the Greeks.)

When thy hand touched Jesus' Side, thou didst find the perfection of good things ; for, as a mystic sponge, thou didst thence imbibe the water of life, the fount of all that is good, and didst drink in ever- lasting life ; whereby thou didst cleanse men's minds from ignorance, giving them to drink of the divine dogmas of the knowledge of God.

Thou didst, by thine own in- credulity and thy after-faith, coufirm such as were tempted; for thou didst proclaim to all men, how He, that is thy Lord and thy God, became incar- nate on this earth for us, was nailed to the Cross and suf- fered death, and had his Side opened with a spear, whence we draw life.

Thou didst make all the Indies shine with much light, O most holy Apostle, thou eontemplator of the Divinity ! For after thou hadst en- lightened these people, and

Domini palpato latere, bo- norum assecutus es summi- tatem ; nam velut spongia hinc hausisti latices, fontem bonorum, seternamque po- tasti vitam, mentibus expel- lens ignorantiam, divinaque Dei cognitionis dogmata sca- turire faciens.

Tua incredulitate et tua fide stabilisti tentatos, nun- ciare incipiens omni creaturae Deum ac Dominum, carne pro nobis in terris indutum, crucein mortemque subeun- tem, clavis perforatum, cujus lancea latus apertum, ex quo vitam haurimus.

Divina videns, Christi Sa- pientise spiritualis demon- stratus es crater mysticus, O Thoma Apostole, in quern, fidelium animae lsetantur, et Spiritus sagena populos eru- isti ex abysso ignorantise : unde ex Sion sicut fluvius devenisti charitatis, tua di- vina scaturire faciens dog- mata in omnem creaturam.

made them to be children of the light and day, thou, by the Spirit of God, didst wisely overthrow the temples of their idols, and didst ele- vate the people to the love of God, making them an honour and a glory to the Church, O thou that help est us by thy intercession !

By the vision thou hadst of divine things, thou be- camest, O Apostle Thomas ! the mystic cup of the Wis- dom of Christ, which gives joy to the souls of the faith- ful. Thou wast the spiritual net, drawing men from the sea of ignorance. Hence is it, that thou earnest from Sion as a stream of charity, watering the world with the divine dogmas. Thou didst imitate the passion of Jesus, thou wast pierced in thy side, thou hast put on immorta- lity. Pray to God, that he have mercy on our souls.

O glorious Apostle Thomas ! who didst lead to Christ so many unbelieving nations, hear now the prayers of the faithful, who beseech thee to lead them to that same Jesus, who, in five days, will have shown himself to his Church. That we may merit to ap- pear in his divine presence, we need, before all other graces, the light which leads to him. That light is Faith ; then, pray that we may have Faith. Hereto- fore, our Saviour had compassion on thy weakness, and deigned to remove from thee the doubt of his having risen from the grave; pray to him for us, that he will mercifully come to our assistance, and make himself felt by our heart. We ask not, O holy Apostle ! to see him with the eyes of our body, but

DEC. 21. ST. THOMAS. 525

with those of oar faith, for he said to thee, when he showed himself to thee : Blessed are they who have not seen, and have believed ! Of this happy number, we desire to be. We beseech thee, therefore, pray that we may obtain the Faith of the heart and will, /that so, when we behold the divine Infant wrapped in swaddling-clothes and laid in a manger, we may cry out : My Lord ! and niy God ! Pray, 0 holy Apostle, for the nations thou didst evangelise, but which have fallen back again into the shades of death. May the day soon come, when the Sun of Justice will once more shine upon them. Bless the efforts of those apostolic men, who have devoted their labours and their very lives to the work of the Missions; pray that the daj^s of darkness may be shortened, and that the countries, which were watered by thy blood, may at length see that kingdom of God established amongst them, which thou didst preach to them, and for which we also are in waiting.

and in the shadow of death.

O Jesus, divine Sun ! thou art coming to snatch us from eternal night: blessed for ever be thy infinite goodness ! But thou puttest our faith to the test, before showing thyself in all thy brightness. Thou hidest thy rays, until the time decreed by thy heavenly Father comes, in which all thy beauty will break upon the world. Thou art traversing Judea ; thou art near Jerusalem; the journey of Mary and Joseph is nigh its term. Crowds of men pass or meet thee on the road, each one hurrying to his native town, there to be enrolled, as the Edict commands. Not one of all these suspects that thou, O divine Orient ! art so near him. They see thy Mother Mary, and they see nothing in her above the rest of women ; or if they are impressed by the majesty and incomparable modesty of this august Queen, it is but a vague feel- ing of surprise at there being such dignity in one so poor as she is ; and they soon forget her again. If the Mother is thus an object of indifference to them, it is not to be expected that they will give even so much as a thought to her Child, that is not yet born. And yet this Child is thyself, 0 Sun of Justice ! Oh ! increase our Faith, but increase, too, our Love. If these men loved thee, O Redeemer of mankind, thou

wouldst give them tlie grace to feel thy presence ; their eyes, indeed, would not yet see thee, but their hearts, at least, would burn within them, they would long for thy Coming, and would hasten it by their prayers and sighs. Dearest Jesus ! who thus tra- versest the world thou hast created, and who forcest not the homage of thy creatures, we wish to keep near thee during the rest of this thy journey: we kiss the footsteps of Her that carries thee in her womb ; we will not leave thee, until we arrive to- gether with thee at Bethlehem, that House of Bread, where, at last, our eyes will see thee, O splendour of eternal light, our Lord and our God !

PRAYER FOR THE TIME OF ADVENT.

{The 'Mozarabic Breviary, Monday oftlie Fifth Week, Oratio.)

0 God, our Father ! what horrid crime is this I see committed in thy presence by the reprobate Jews ! They spurn thy Son, that was fore- told in the Law, and remain in the gulf of their incredu- lity : whereas, they, to whom he was not announced, have seen him ; and they who heard not, contemplated him, in their spirit. Remove, therefore, we beseech thee, from us all that resists thee in our conduct, that so, with a believing heart, we may in such manner bring forth the branches of thy gifts be- stowed on us, as that the root of humility may never dry up within us. Amen.

Immane satis facinus vi- deo coram tuis, Deus Pater, oculis a reprobis perpetra- tum : qui, dum Filium tuum, prseclicatum in Lege, contem- nunt, _ in incredulitatis suae voragine remanserunt ; dum hi quibus non erat de eo nun- tiatum, viderunt eum, et qui non audierunt, intelligentia contemplati sunt.

0 King of Nations ! thou art approaching still nigher to Bethlehem, where thou art to be born. The journey is almost over, and thy august Mother, consoled and strengthened by the dear weight she bears, holds an unceasing converse with thee on the way. She adores thy divine Majesty ; she gives thanks to thy mercy ; she rejoices that she has been chosen for the sublime ministry of being Mother to God. She longs for that happy moment when her eyes shall look upon thee, and yet she fears it. For, how will she be able to render thee those ser- vices which are due to thy infinite greatness, she that thinks herself the last of creatures ? How will she dare to raise thee up in her arms, and press thee to her heart, and feed thee at her breasts ? When she reflects that the hour is now near at hand, in which, being born of her, thou wilt require all her care and tenderness, her heart sinks within her; for, what human heart could bear the intense vehemence of these two affections, — the love of such a Mother for her Babe, and the love of such a Creature for her God ? But thou supportest her, 0 thou the Desired

of Nations ! for thou, too, longest for that happy Birth, which is to give the earth its Saviour, and to men that Corner- Stone, which will unite them all into one family. Dearest King ! be thou blessed for all these wonders of thy power and goodness ! Come speedily, we beseech thee, come and save us, for we are dear to thee, as creatures that have been formed by thy divine hands. Yea, Come, for thy creation has grown degenerate ; it is lost ; death has taken possession of it : take it thou again into thy almighty hands, and give it a new creation ; save it; for thou hast not ceased to take pleasure in and love thine own work.

But, to-day, thou enterest the city of David and Solomon unnoticed and unknown. It lies on thy road to Bethlehem. Thy Blessed Mother and Joseph, her Spouse, would not lose the opportunity of visiting the Temple, there to offer to the Lord their prayers and adoration. They enter ; and then, for the first time, is accomplished the pro- phecy of Aggeus, that great shall be the glory of this last House more than of the first ; 1 for this second

The Laivgiver himself is in this blessed Ark, and not merely, as in that of old, the tablet of stone on which the Law was graven. The visit paid, our living Ark descends the steps of the Temple, and sets out once more for Bethlehem, where other prophecies are to be fulfilled. We adore tbee, 0 Emmanuel ! in this thy journey, and we reverence the fidelity wherewith thou fulfillest all that the prophets have written of thee, for thou wouldst give to thy people the certainty of thy being the Messias, by showing them, that all the marks, whereby he was to be known, are to be found in thee. And now, the hour is near ; all is ready for thy Birth ; come, then, and save us ; come, that thou mayest not only be called our Emmanuel, but our Jesus, that is, He that saves us.

" At length," says St. Peter Damian, in his Sermon for this holy Eve, " at length we have got from the " stormy sea into the tranquil port; hitherto it was the " promise, now it is the prize ; hitherto labour, now " rest ; hitherto despair, now hope ; hitherto the way, "now our home. The heralds of the divine promise " came to us ; but they gave us nothing but rich pro- "mises. Hence, our Psalmist himself grew wearied, "and slept, and, with a seeming reproachful tone, " thus sings his lamentation to God : But thou hast " rejected and despised us ; thou hast deferred the " coming of thy Christ.1 At another time he assumes " a tone of demand, and thus prays : 0 thou that " sittest upon the Cherubim, shoiv thyself ! 2 Seated " on thy high throne, with myriads of adoring Angels "around thee, look down upon the children of men, "who are victims of that sin, which was committed "indeed by Adam, but permitted by thy justice. 11 Remember what my substance is ;3 thou didst " make it to the likeness of thine own ; for though "every living man is vanity, yet inasmuch as he is " made to thy Image, he is not a passing vanity} " Bend thy heavens and come down, and turn the " eyes of thy mercy upon us thy miserable suppliants, " and forget us not unto the end !

"Isaias, also, in the vehemence of his desire, thus " spoke : For Sion's sake I will not hold my peace, " and for the sake of Jerusalem I tvill not rest, till

1 Ps. lxxxviii. 2 Ibid, lxxix. 3 Ibid, lxxxviii. 4 Ibid, xxxviii.

" her Just One come forth as brightness. Oh ! that " thou wouldst rend the heavens, and wouldst come " doivn ! So, too, all the Prophets, tired of the long " delay of the Coming, have prayed to thee, now with "supplication, now with lamentation, and now with "cries of impatience. We have listened to these " their prayers ; we have made use of them as our " own, and now, nothing can give us joy or gladness, " till our Saviour come to us, and, kissing us with the " kiss of his lips, say to us, / have heard and granted " your prayers.

" But, what is this that has been said to us : " Sanctify yourselves, 0 ye children of Israel, and be "ready; for on the morrow, the Lord will come " down ? We are, then, but one half day and night ™ from the grand visit, the admirable Birth of the " Infant-God ! Hurry on your course, ye fleeting " hours, that we may the sooner see the Son of God in "his crib, and pay our homage to this world-saving "Birth. You, Brethren, are the Children of Israel, " that are sanctified, and cleansed from every denle- "rnent of soul and body, ready, by your earnest "devotion, for to-morrow's mysteries. Sueh, indeed, "you are, if I may judge from the manner in which " you have spent these sacred days of preparation for " the Coming of your Saviour.

" But if, notwithstanding all your care, some drops " of the stream of this life's frailties are still on your " hearts, wipe them away and cover them with the " snow-white robe of Confession. This I can promise "you from the mercy of the divine Infant : he that " shall confess his sins and be sorry for them, shall " have born within him the Light of the World ; the " darkness that deceived him, shall be dispelled ; and " he shall enjoy the brightness of the true Light. " For how can mercy be denied to the miserable this " night, in which the merciful and compassionate " Lord is so mercifully born ? Therefore, drive away

534 ADVENT.

" from you all haughty looks, and idle words, and " unjust works ; let your loins be girt, and your feet " walk in the right paths ; and then come, and accuse " the Lord, if this night he rend not the heavens, and " come down to you, and throw all your sins into the " depths of the sea."

This holy Eve is, indeed, a day of grace and hope, and we ought to spend it in spiritual joy. The Church, contrary to her general practice, prescribes, that if Christmas Eve fall on a Sunday, the fasting alone should be anticipated on the Saturday; but that the Office and Mass of the Vigil should take prece- dence of the Office and Mass of the fourth Sunday of Advent. How solemn, then, in the eyes of the Church, are these few hours which separate us from the great Feast 1 On all other Feasts, no matter how great they may be, the solemnity begins with first Vespers, and until then the Church restrains her joy, and cele- brates the Divine Office and Sacrifice according to the Lenten rite. Christmas, on the contrary, seems to begin with the Vigil ; and one would suppose that this morning's Lauds were the opening of the Feast ; for the solemn intonation of this portion of the Office is that of a Double, and the Antiphons are sung before and after each Psalm or Canticle. The purple Vestments are used at the Mass, but all the genu- flexions peculiar to the Advent Ferias are omitted ; and only one Collect is said, instead of three, which always denote that the Mass is not that of a solemnity.

Let us enter into the spirit of the Church, and pre- pare ourselves, in all the joy of our hearts, to meet the Saviour who is coming to us. Let us observe with strictness the fast which is prescribed ; it will enable our bodies to aid the promptness of our spirit. Let us delight in the thought, that before we again lay down to rest, we shall have seen Him born, in the solemn mid-night, who comes to give light to every creature. For, surely, it is the duty of every faithful

child of the Catholic Church to celebrate, with her, this happy Night, when, in spite of all the coldness of devotion, the whole universe keeps up its watch for the arrival of its Saviour. It is one of the last vestiges of the piety of ancient days, and God forbid it should ever be effaced \

Let us, in a spirit of prayer, look at the principal portions of the Office of this beautiful Vigil. First, then, the Church makes a mysterious announcement to her children. It serves, as the Invitatory of Matins, and as the Introit and Gradual of the Mass. They are the words which Moses addressed to the people of God, when he told them of the heavenly Manna, which they would receive on the morrow. We, too, are expecting our Manna, our Jesus, the Bread of life, who is to be born in Bethlehem, which is the House of Bread.

At the Office of Prime, in Cathedral Chapters and Monasteries, the announcement of to-morrow's Feast is made with unusual solemnity. The Lector, who frequently is one of the dignitaries of the Choir, sings, to a magnificent chant, the following Lesson from the Martyrology. All the assistants remain standing during it, until the Lector comes to the word Bethle- hem, at which all genuflect, and continue in that posture until all the glad Tidings are told.

In the Epistle, the Apostle St. Paul, addressing himself to the Romans, makes known to them the dignity and holiness of the Gospel, that is, of those Good Tidings, which the Angels are to bring to us this very night. Now, the subject of this Gospel is Jesus, the Son that is born unto God, of the family of David, according to the flesh. This Jesus comes that he may be, to his Church, the source of grace and apostleship. It is by these two gifts that we are still associated, after so many ages, to the joys of the great Mystery of his Birth in Bethlehem.

one of the preludes to the Birth of our Saviour, could not but enter into the Liturgy for Advent ; and so far, there was no suitable occasion for its insertion. The Yigil of Christmas was the right day for this Gospel, for another reason : the Angel, in speaking to St. Joseph, tells him, that the name to be given to the Child of Mary is Jesus, which signifies that he will save his people from their sins.

Sequel of the holy Gospel Sequentia sancti Evangelii according to Matthew. secundum Matthseum.

Ch. I.

When Mary, the Mother of Jesus, was espoused to Jo- seph, before they came to- gether, she was found with child of the Holy Ghost. Whereupon Joseph her hus- band, being a just man, and not willing publicly to expose her, was minded to put her away privately. But while he thought on these things, behold the Angel of the Lord appeared to him in his sleep, saying: Joseph, son of David, fear not to take unto thee' Mary thy wife, for that which is conceived in her is of the Holy Ghost. And she shall bring forth a Son : and thou shalt call his name Jesus ; for he shall save his people from their sins.

The Ambrosian and Mozarabic Liturgies have nothing in their Office and Mass for this Vigil which we deem telling enough for insertion here. In the Anthology of the Greeks there is a Hymn, which will assist our devotion, and from which we take the following stanzas. It is called : The beginning of the Hours of the Nativity : Tierce, Sext, and None.

HYMN FOR THE VIGIL OF CHRISTMAS.

(Taken from the Anthology of the Greeks.)

On a certain day, there was enrolled at Bethlehem, together with the old man Joseph, as being of the fa- mily of David, Mary, who bore in her virginal womb the divine fruit. The time of her delivery was come, and there was no place in the inn ; and instead of a splen- did palace for the Queen, there was but a cave.

The moment is come for the accomplishment of the mystic prophecy : "And thou Bethlehem, land of Juda, art not the least' among the princes, for thou art the first to adorn the Cave. For there shall come to me from thee the leader of the Nations, born of a Virgin-Maid accord- ing to the flesh ; it is Christ, who is God, and he shall rule his new people of Israel." Let us all give him highest praise.

This is our- God, and there is none other; he was born of a Virgin, and he conversed with men ; the Only Begotten Son becomes Mortal, and is laid in a poor crib ; the Lord of glory is wrapped in swad- dling-clothes : the star in- vites the Magi to adore him, and let us sing : 0 Holy Trinity, save our souls !

Come, all ye faithful : let us be transported with divine enthusiasm ; let us look at God coming in a visible form from on high and descending

Inscribebatur die quadam cum sene Joseph, tanquam ex semine David, in Bethle- hem, Maria, sine semine foetum utero gestans ; adve- nerat pariendi temp us, et nullus erat in diversorio lo- cus, sed pro splendido paktio spelunca Reginse aderat.

Adimpleri nunc urget pro- pheticum praeconium mystice nuncians : Et tn, Bethlehem, terra Juda, nequaquam mi- nima es in principibus, prima adornans speluncam. Ex te enim niihi veniet dux gen- tium, per carnem ex puella Virgine, Christus Deus qui reget populum suum novum Israel. Demus ei omnes mag- nificentiam.

into Bethlehem ; then raising up our minds, let us bring to him our virtues as the myrrh we offer him, thus pre- paring, with faith, for his Birth among us : let us sing, Glory in the highest be to God, one in three Persons, whose good-will to man is thus made manifest ! for thou, O Jesus ! the Lover of man, hast redeemed Adam and restored the work of thy hands !

Hear, O ye heavens, and give ear, O earth ! let the foundations of the earth be moved, and all the earth tremble : for God the maker of man has himself put on a created form, and He whose creative hand upheld his crea- tures, has, by mercy moved, clothed himself with a body. O the depth of the riches of the wisdom and of the know- ledge of God ! How incom- prehensible are his judg- ments, and how unsearchable his ways !

O come, ye Christian peo- ple ! let us see the prodigy that stupefies all thought and holds it in suspense ; then let us devoutly adore, and sing our hymns with hearts full of faith. This day there hath come to Beth- lehem a Maid that is to give birth to God ! Choirs of Angels are already there ! Joseph, her Spouse, seeing her, has already received his answer to his question : What is this mystery which I see in thee, pure Virgin ] How canst thou bring forth, that

never hast borne a mother's humiliation 1

This day, there is born of a Virgin, He that holds in his hand the whole creation. He whose very essence 'tis to be untangible, is become mortal and is bound in swath- ing-bands. He who, of old, in the beginning, poised and set the heavens, is laid in a manger. He who rained down Manna on his people in the desert, is fed with milk at his Mother's breast. The Spouse of the Church invites the Magi ; the Son of the Virgin accepts their gifts. We adore thy Nativity, O Jesus ! show unto us thy divine manifestations.

Hodie nascitur ex Virgine qui pugillo omnem creaturam continet : panniculis sicut mortalis fasciatur qui essen- tia intactibilis est; Deus in praesepio reclinatur, qui olim in principio ccelos stabilivit ; ex uberibus lacte nutritur per quern in deserto manna plue- bat populo ; Magos advocat Sponsus Ecclesise ; dona il- lorum accipit Virginis Filius. Adoramus tuam Nativita- tem, Christe ; ostende nobis tuas divinas Theophanias.

Let us contemplate our Blessed Lady, and her faithful Spouse Joseph, leaving the city of Jerusalem, and continuing their journey to Bethlehem, which they reach after a ipw hours. In obedience to the will of heaven, they immediately repair to the place where their names are to be enrolled, as the Em- peror's edict requires. There is entered in the public register, Joseph, a carpenter of Nazareth in Galilee. To his name, there is, doubtless, added that of Mary, Spouse of the above-named Joseph. Perhaps they enter her as a young woman, in the ninth month of her pregnancy. And this is all ! — O Incarnate Word ! thou art not yet counted by men ! Thou art upon this earth of thine, and men set thee down as nothing ! And yet, all this excitement of the enrol- ment of the world is to be for nothing else but this, — that Mary, thy august Mother, may come to Beth- lehem, and there give thee Birth !

O ineffable Mystery ! how grand is this apparent littleness ! how mighty this divine weakness ! But

546 ADVENT.

God has still lower to descend than merely coming on our earth. He goes from house to house of his people : not one will receive him. He must go and seek a crib in the stable of poor dumb beasts. There, until such time as the Angels sing to him their hymn, and the Shepherds and the Magi come with their offerings, he will meet "the ox that knoweth " its Owner, and the ass that knoweth its Master's " crib!"1 O Saviour of men, Emmanuel, Jesus! we, too, will go to this stable of Bethlehem. Thy New Birth, which is to-night, shall not be without loving and devoted hearts to bless it. At this very hour, thou art knocking at the doors of Bethlehem, and who is there that will take thee iu ? Thou sayest to my soul in the words of the Canticle : " Open to me, " my sister, my beloved ! for my head is full of dew, "and my locks of the drops of the night!"2 Ah ! sweet Jesus ! thou shalt not be refused here ! I be- seech thee, enter my house. I have been watching and longing for thee. Gome, then, Lord Jesus ! come ! 3
